When drawn in a more serious style, Saitama is revealed to have sharp facial features, fearsome eyes, and chiseled musculature. His posture changes as well, with a slack posture and sloping shoulders when lax, and a straightened posture and squared shoulders when serious. Saitama's hero costumeconsists of a yellow one-piece jumpsuit with a short zipper at the collar and a black belt with a round golden buckle at its center. He wears red gloves that go 3/4 up his forearms and red boots that nearly reach his knees. His costume is finished with a white cape, fastened to his shoulders with big, round buttons. Saitama owns several shirts and hoodies with various designs. This includes his: Saitama's character on the upper surface can be best summed up as \\\"average\\\". At first glance, nothing about him strikes anyone he meets or causes them to note anything remarkable about him. Before becoming a hero, he was an average salaryman and did not seem interested in anything initially, though becoming a hero has always been a dream of Saitama's.[27]Before becoming one, he used to be frustrated about society, just likeHammerheadand even commenting that he could have become just like them depending on the path he took.[28] Due to his great power and being virtually indestructible, Saitama is an indifferent person. Even the mightiest foes pose no challenge to him, so he does not take his hero work seriously, goes through everything with little to no effort, and yearns for an opponent that can provide him with a challenge.[29]The lack of worthy opponents has led him to suffer from a self-imposed existential crisis,[7]and he claims that his ability to feel any emotions has dulled considerably.[30]The combination of his attitude, unstoppable power, and \\\"unimpressive\\\" appearance often causes his battles to become anticlimactic. Saitama will usually allow his opponents to rant about their motives and power up into their strongest forms, before obliterating them with a single punch.[31] Saitama's indifferent expression after knowing people speaking ill of him Saitama's indifference doesn't rest solely on his hero work either. In daily life, he is often seen lounging around, playing video games, reading manga, or going out for strolls. His taste in food is rather plain, and he often frequents food stalls rather than going to restaurants or cooking at home. As his primary interest, hero work has become unfulfilling, and he pays little attention to anything else. A running gag about Saitama is his inability to remember people's faces and names, as seen when he forgotSpeed-o'-Sound Sonic's name,[32]or when he could not remember whoTanktop Tigerwas.[33]Because of this, he sometimes ends up pronouncing people's names incorrectly, much to their chagrin.[34]Saitama does not care if people insult him, and he usually ignores them and says that they need a hobby;[35]the only insult that could get a reaction out of him is anything about his lack of hair.[36][37]He has expressed distaste towards his officially assigned hero name, Caped Baldy. Thus, even after receiving it, he always refers to himself as Saitama. Saitama's reaction knowing he will miss a bargain sale Despite his indifference, Saitama can find things that interest him and actively looks for activities to relieve his boredom. These things tend to be mundane activities such as watching TV, shopping, or playing games. He shows a measure of concern when it comes to bargains and deals, as seen when he foughtCarnage Kabuto, where he was more shocked upon the realization that he was going to miss a bargain sale, rather than his opponent, who had undergone atransformationand was beating him around.[38] Saitama gets impatient with Genos' explanation He can also express irritation and even outright anger depending on the situation. However, Saitama has limited patience for long explanations and often interrupts the speaker.[39][40][41]His ideal word count is 20 or less.[39]He can get angry when he loses to someone like King when they play games. He will become enraged if anyone messes with his food or damages his home as he immediately killed a mantis monster for crashing through his roof and told Genos to move his fight with Sonic somewhere away from his apartment. Aside from being quite a cheapskate due to his financial status, he has a greedy side seen when he tried to steal bags of gold from the underground mine inside theMonster Association Headquartersand was visibly upset after accidentally dropping them down to the bottom of an underground ravine.[42] Despite his general indifference to most things, Saitama was genuinely shocked when he realized that no one knew of him despite his achievements, curious as to why he doesn't have any fans. This reaction demonstrates that while he isn't necessarily into hero work for fame, he certainly doesn't object to it.[43]Another running joke is Saitama's jealousy of higher rankings, such as when he grew irritated whenGenoslisted off all of the comments made by fans about how amazing Genos is in their eyes. Beneath the surface, Saitama is much more complex than his appearance and attitude suggest. While he scored low on the written portion of the hero exam, he is, by no means, unintelligent. Saitama is very observant, insightful, and has high tactical awareness. This is seen in how he could easily discern situations and character traits from the people and environment around him. He could pick up several hints about Sonic's persona upon their first meeting.[44]When two tank top heroes jealously plotted to ruin him after themeteor event, he remarked that there were irate and self-serving hero types like them. He was even able to discernFubuki's forced offer of submission or destruction just before his crackdown on how the hero world really works than how it is currently run.[45]Saitama has shown remorse to his enemies before, particularly those who can give him a stimulating fight and don't just go down in one hit. One such example of this isBoros, the self-claimed \\\"Dominator of the Universe\\\", with whom Saitama sympathized due to suffering from similar circumstances, though, in the end, even Boros still could not draw out Saitama's full power.[46] Saitama tends to come off as abrasive to others and often is inconsiderate of their feelings or how his words affect them. That isn't to say he is intentionally malicious or rude, but rather that his indifference extends to his social interactions. He reacted to Fubuki greeting him as the number 1 B-Class heroine with a quick acknowledgement but seemed otherwise unimpressed frustrating Fubuki. He also downplays the gravity of situations based on his own perspective rather than that of others, never considering that those without his earth-shattering power would be rightly more horrified in extreme cases like Boros threatening to destroy the world or the monster society declaring open war on humanity. During his fight with Garou, Saitama initially displayed his unconcerned attitude against the Human Monster, from playful banter to compliments on Garou's capability. Saitama turning the civilians against him Despite his aloof, carefree, and uninterested personality, Saitama is actually one of the most morally upright heroes in the story. While many other heroes only care about personal achievements so they can rank up in order to gain more fame and popularity, Saitama is very humble, as he purposefully let the masses turn against him in order for the defeated heroes to be given credit for their efforts against theDeep Sea King, even claiming that they had weakened the monster before his arrival wanting to give credit to the heroes that were actually risking their lives to protect innocent people.[47]Saitama did the same for thepolice station, killing a monster while disguised as apolice officer, despite potentially gaining much fame had he revealed who he actually was as he heard the Hero Association executive try to force the police to beg for assistance exclaiming that, \\\"Police and heroes don't help people because someone had to beg\\\".[48]This is also his outlook on being a hero as he told Genos, \\\"If heroes run and hide, who will stand and fight\\\". He also did not mind thatKingtook credit for all of his achievements.[49]One of the most understated signs of Saitama's high morality is that he never uses his incredible strength for evil, even though no one can stop him from doing whatever he wants. Saitama telling Genos he's gotten stronger Although he may initially rub people the wrong way and seldom shows his emotions to others, it doesn't mean Saitama doesn't show care for the people around him or their physical or mental well-being. On some occasions, he's helped people with their mental issues, such as a suicidal man wanting to jump off a building,[50]and giving words of encouragement to Fubuki about how she should not seek the approval of others but live her life how she wanted.[51]He promisedTareoto stop Garou without killing him,[52]and complemented Genos after the cyborg saved Tatsumaki by claiming that his heart had grown stronger.[53] While he has no problem killing monsters, Saitama has yet to be seen killing anotherhumanand only ever uses enough strength to knock them out. His restraint is so ingrained that no matter the opponent's power and no matter how much Saitama knows about them, he only kills when he intends to kill, even if he hits someone unexpectedly, such as the number of times he's knocked out Garou. Saitama exhibiting a somber demeanor following Genos' death in the Ominous Future In theOminous Future, after the devastating deaths of Genos and numerous other heroes at the hands of Garou, Saitama becomes despondent. He begins questioning his abilities and intuition as a hero, lamenting that he tends to arrive too late to prevent such tragic outcomes. Quickly, this changes into a state of tranquil anger, where he decides to no longer hold back against Garou. The death of Genos also causes Saitama to lose any potential excitement at facing the Hero Hunter, despite considering Garou a strong opponent who may provide him with a challenging fight, showing his depression at his disciple's end.[54]In spite of his anger towards Garou for his cruel doings, at the end of their fight, Saitama recalls his promise to Tareo about not killing Garou (or he has always kept it in mind during the fight). He eventually calms down and reverts to his casual, relaxed demeanor, complying with the Hero Hunter's request to teach him a time travel technique. Garou later comments that individuals of such immense power as himself and Saitama require the presence of others to act as anchors, to help them maintain their sanity - the sense of isolation that accompanies such unparalleled strength can be enough to drive even the most powerful beings to the brink of madness.[55] Saitama motivates Glasses to become stronger Saitama has proven to be a good figure to other people, both heroes and villains alike. His influence made Genos quit his revenge wishes and start focusing on training to become a good and strong hero.[56][57]He has also made insecure people like Fubuki andGlassesstand up to their challenges and become better heroes.[58]Saitama also advises King to train and become strong for real, rather than being upset the latter stole credit from his battles.[59] As Genos notes, Saitama \\\"attracts the strong\\\", as many powerful heroes and villains have taken a liking to him.[60]This is due to his lack of interest in hero ranking and fame that attracts them.[61] Saitama is the titularOne-Punch Manand the strongest character in the series. So far, no enemy has been able to injure him in any way, and almost no enemy has been able to survive a single earnest punch from him. A few enemies havesurvivedpunches from him, such as any human he has struck (whom he restrains himself against) and Boros, whom Saitama empathized with and held back against so as to give himself and Boros a satisfying and stimulating fight. His strength is so great that it vastly eclipses even artificial beings designed or bred specifically for superhuman combat, such asmechanical beingsor the mutated warriors from theHouse of Evolution. Since no enemies have posed any real challenge to Saitama yet, the upper bound of his strength is likely even higher than it currently appears. The only opponent (so far) who has actually made him put visible effort into defeating was Garou, whose powers and abilities were enhanced by \\\"God\\\", and that's mostly due to the former's ability to copy Saitama's strength so as to fight him as an equal. While his power is only limited to heightened human traits (he cannot fly or fire energy blasts), his superhuman abilities are more than enough to compensate for the lack of variety in his powers. The origin of Saitama's immense strength is mysterious and unclear. Although he tells everyone he got his incredible power through mere physical training, no one believes him at all.[63]According to Saitama, after a year and a half of 100 daily push-ups, sit-ups, and squats, plus 10 km daily running, he had achieved some level of superhuman strength.[63]This training was apparently so intense for Saitama that he at times felt he might die, and claims that it is what caused all of his hair to suddenly and eventually fall out.[63]Genos believes that Saitama himself does not actually know or understand how he gained his power, and hopes to learn the secret by sparring with and observing him,[64]whileDr. Genusbelieves that Saitama worked out with said training regimen so hard that he had removed hislimiter.[65]It should be noted that Saitama would complete all parts of the training one after the other without breaks and was battling monsters that appeared during that time, which would have made completing the training more intense than it would normally be expected. Genos beating Saitama in an eating contest Despite his unbelievable physical prowess, Saitama can be outperformed by people with skills in areas outside fighting, like when he was bested byBangin a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors or defeated byKingin video games, mostly in one-sided matches.[66][67]Furthermore, he also seems to possess a normal human appetite, as he lost to Genos in a spicy noodle eating contest.[68] Saitama displays overwhelming strength in his punches Unparalleled Strength: Saitama possesses seemingly limitless physical strength and is capable of effortlessly defeating powerful monsters and villains with a single, casual punch (although this strength is not limited to punches). His punches are so powerful that many monsters simply explode when struck. An example of this casual yet overwhelming offensive power occurs when Saitama launches himself from the top of a building, blasts right through a giantmeteorwith a punch, lands safely, and calmly decides to go home.[69]Another instance is when Sonic tries to attack Saitama with a sword; he stops the sword by catching it with his teeth, effortlessly shattering the blade with the power of his jaw.[70]When launched fromEarthto the moon by Boros, he used his jumping power to return to Earth in mere moments, causing a huge shockwave and leaving a massive crater on the surface of the moon upon departure.[71]A \\\"normal\\\" punch from him was shown to be highly destructive, even to someone as durable as Boros.[72]A \\\"serious\\\" punch from him was able to counter the latter's strongest attack,Collapsing Star Roaring Cannon, an attack capable of destroying the planet or its surface. Not only did Saitama completely negate Boros' final attack using his serious punch, but the shockwave from the punch was also powerful enough to part clouds on a global scale.[73]When fightingOrochi, the high-speed pressure of the lava fired from his hands was enough to overpower and completely disperse Orochi'sGaia Cannon, an incredibly powerful attack that drew energy from the Earth's core and caused worldwide earthquakes.[74]Additionally, he is capable of destroying the Earth if he wanted to,[75]and has threatened to do so when irritated.[76]His strength has been stated by numerous characters to defy reason.[77][78][79] Saitama dispersing Jupiter's gases with a sneeze With only one hand, Saitama could lift the entire surface ofIo, a moon ofJupiter, launching its wreckage intospace.[80]In his fight againstCosmic Fear ModeGarou, whose copying powers allowed him to wield Saitama's strength himself, a collision between twoSerious Punches from them produced aSerious Punch\\u00b2that resulted in immensely powerful waves of energy able to destroy the Earth. After being diverted by Blast and his allies, the compressed energy from the collision further travelled into outer space before exploding and presumably destroying numerousstar systemsin the far distance, leaving a massive hole of starless-darkness in the cosmos.[81]In the climax of the fight against Garou on Io, Saitama was able to accidentally blow away half the gas of Jupiter, the largest planet in the solar system, with aSerious Sneeze.[82] Saitama jumps off the moon Saitama dodging Genos's attack Unparalleled Speed and Reflexes: Saitama possesses unparalleled speed and reflexes. He was able to complete a 1500-meter dash in an instant during his hero tryouts.[88]He has proven able to effortlessly outpaceSpeed-o'-Sound Sonic, a ninja whose specialty is his superspeed.[89][90]Even Genos's computerized targeting systems have difficulty tracking him.[91]He once ran down a building to save a piece of salmon he was having for lunch, and leap back up said building without bystanders noticing he had even done so.[50]His speed is so impressive that he can outpaceFlashy Flash, an S-Class hero well-known for his extraordinary speed, easily dodging and catching his sword swings.[92]When kicked to the moon by Boros, he quickly made a jump back to Earth, demonstrating the ability to travel at high-speeds.[93]In addition, he was capable of easily reacting to and blocking rocks thrown at near-lightspeed byGeryuganshoop,[94]the speed of which being like a bad joke to him.[95] Saitama travelling across a moon at incredibly high speeds In hisfightagainst evolved monster Garou, Saitama proved himself firmly superior to and able to effortlessly keep up with him, despite the Hero Hunter previously being capable of creating a giant light structure alongsidePlatinum Spermin only 1.3 milliseconds (0.0013 seconds) through sheer speed.[96][97][98]On Io, one ofJupiter's moons, after flipping a large amount of ground into the air with hisSerious Table Flip, he was capable of covering immensely huge distances by dashing across tons of rubble, having jumped around the natural satellite so fast that a large constellation was created from his sheer speed.[99]Ironically, despite his incomparable reflexes and speed, he still has problems squashing a simple mosquito.[100] During a training day when he still had hair, Saitama attempted to quickly turn his head to see the back of it in a mirror. Although he failed at first, in the end, he supposedly managed to glimpse the back of his head.[101]It is likely that achieving this would require him to move his head at a speed approaching that of light, along with having reflexes and reaction times as quick, ensuring that the reflected image in the mirror would not have enough time to change significantly before his eyes could perceive it, so to speak. Saitama creating countless afterimages Superhuman Stamina and Endurance: After becoming too powerful from his training regimen, Saitama has no longer been shown to tire out when fighting enemies. The only time he was shown to be panting and out of breath from continuous running, he recovered just seconds later.[110]He could still suppress pain even before gaining his overwhelming power.[111][112]This has been shown on numerous occasions dating back to his days as a middle school student, taking a beating from two upper-level students and, laterPiggy Bancon, a Wolf-level threat. Saitama then got back up when the bullies could not and chased after the pig-like monster for his money.[113]Other similar feats include enduring strikes fromCrablanteandPersonification Of A Light Pull Cordduring his training as an adult among others. Superhuman Eyesight: Saitama's eyesight is superhuman; after being kicked to the Moon by Boros, he could see, pinpoint the location of thegiant spaceship, and land back on it from the lunar distance.[93]His tracking capability is also astonishing, as he can concentrate on a fast-moving object for a long time and still not lose sight of it, as seen when he was the only person to see where Garou escaped to.[114][115]He is also able to see in the dark, as he was able to spot a kid a great distance away during the night.[116] Invulnerability: Saitama possesses unparalleled toughness and durability, being able to withstand attacks from even the most powerfulMysterious Beingswithout the slightest damage.[117]In fact, no character has actually been able to damage, or even physically harm Saitama in any way. When Genos created a huge, spherical blast of flame to killMosquito Girl's mosquitoes, Saitama remained standing right next to him completely unharmed (though his clothes were burnt).[118]Another testament to his astonishing durability is that Garou, who, despite having gained enormous strength from monsterization, still could not inflict even the slightest damage on Saitama during their fight.[96][97]Notably, he was capable of withstanding Garou'sExtreme Fa Jin, an attack powerful enough to raise a large landmass on the other side of the planet, without any injury.[98]When facing a Garou who became influenced by \\\"God\\\", a mysterious entity possessing frightening supernatural powers, Saitama sustained multiple nuclear explosions generated by the Hero Hunter point-blank without any physical harm.[119]Even after taking Garou's Gamma Ray Burst head-on, narratively described as the same phenomenon as agamma ray burst, the most powerful type of explosion known in the universe, he emerged unscathed.[120]Despite Garou utilizing hisMode: Saitama, a supernatural mimicry ability, to harness Saitama's striking power and hit him with it, he could still withstand the assault without noticeable damage.[121] Saitama prefers to dodge or block attacks using edged weapons,[122][123]rather than take them head-on, as he sometimes does with strikes from fists or blunt objects. However,Nyan's powerful claws, which can cut buildings into pieces, were shown unable to affect Saitama's head, indicating his remarkable resistance to piercing damage as well.[124]Additionally, Garou'sWhirlwind Iron Cutting Fistcould only destroy Saitama's clothing without cutting the skin underneath.[125]When being shot by machine guns from Bofoi's highly advanced robots, the bullets bounced harmlessly off his skin. Saitama submerging in lava with no problem Saitama holding his breath on the moon with no difficulty Vacuum Adaptation: Saitama has remarkable control over his breath, demonstrated by his ability to effortlessly hold it even in outer space. He managed to jump from the Moon back to Earth in seconds without showing any signs of suffocation,[131]despite the lack of atmosphere and increased radiation exposure.[132]His body has been shown to adapt to and withstand extraterrestrial environments where oxygen is scarce or absent. For instance, during his battle with Garou on Io, one of Jupiter's moons, he showed no adverse effects from the thin and unbreathable atmosphere there.[133]These feats, along with his exceptional resistance to cosmic radiation and superhuman endurance, suggest that Saitama has the capability to endure the harsh environmental conditions ofouter spaceas well, at least for a decent period of time. Accelerated Development: After almost a year of following his training regimen, Saitama realized that his body had adapted to move with the prowess befitting a true hero that he imagined.[112]As a consequence, his power started to skyrocket at a rapid pace. In a short period, he achieved unparalleled levels of physical abilities, a testament to his extraordinary growth rate. In his fight with Garou onIo, Saitama's growth rate began to soar exponentially due to the intense emotions coursing through him.[121] Saitama enters Phoenix Space, a spiritual space Non-Physical Interaction: Saitama was capable of separating his consciousness from his body to intrude on thePhoenix Space, a mental space that only exists withinPhoenix Man's bird costume, and breaking a hole into it, much to the latter's confusion.[134]Before entering, he could somehow sense thatChild Emperorand Phoenix Man were having a conversation inside the aforementioned spiritual space, and he mistakenly thought that they were talking about his head. After leaving the Phoenix Space, Saitama's consciousness simply returned to his physical body in the same way as Child Emperor's and Phoenix Man's did.[135] Mimicry: Saitama possesses the remarkable ability to learn and replicate other techniques just by witnessing them once. Similarly to Garou, he can not only copy techniques, but also improve upon them. The sheer extent that this mimicry prowess displays is remarkably exceptional, as he was even able to copy Garou's ability to travel through time.[121] Saitama traveling through time Master Hand-to-Hand Combatant: Thanks to many fights with monsters and villains during his training, Saitama has gained a fair amount of fighting experience. Due to his immeasurable power and the resulting boredom, he usually does not focus on technique and relies on basic attacks. Unlikemartial artists, his fighting style is simple but solid, bolstered by his absolute strength. Garou comments that Saitama is an amateur fighter and has many openings to exploit. However, in hisfightagainst Garou onIo, it becomes evident that he is an exceptionally quick learner, capable of mastering any martial arts techniques after observing them only once. Nevertheless, at the end of the day, he chooses to remain a brawler, favoring simple but powerful punches over martial arts. For him, the simplicity of being a brawler is more appealing than mastering complex techniques, as his raw power and speed are more than sufficient to overwhelm his opponents. Saitama also uses karate chops,[138]and grappling moves to take down villains he doesn't want to kill, or just to knock out people who pick on him. Improvisation: Saitama is very proficient with improvised weapons, such as when he killed hisfirst monsterby deftly using his tie to grab the monster's eye and tear out his intestines. He is proficient at improvising in general; whenever he can't solve a fight with a punch or directly can't punch his foe, he always comes up with a solution in one way or another and uses unique moves supported by his immeasurable power. Some of these instances are with hisSerious Table Flip,[139][140]and hisSerious Headbutt.[141] Supernatural Accuracy: Saitama seems to have almost perfect precision since whenever he focuses on a target, he always strikes it. He can turn a rock into a deadly projectile that hits its target, as shown when he killed Geryuganshoop. He also had no trouble landing directly on Boros's ship from the moon, even though the angle to return to Earth was extremely small, leaving little room for error. Normal Series: Saitama's Normal Series consists of techniques in which he puts very little effort into attacking. Even though his attacks are loose in this style, most opponents tend to be finished off easily due to Saitama's tremendous strength and speed. Saitama usingConsecutive Normal Punches Killer Move: Serious Series(\\u5fc5\\u6bba\\u30de\\u30b8\\u30b7\\u30ea\\u30fc\\u30ba,Hissatsu Majishir\\u012bzu): In Serious Series, Saitama puts more effort into his attacks. His face looks more serious when he performs these \\\"serious\\\" attacks. Despite the incredible strength behind them, Saitama does not actually consider these moves to be anything special.[147] Saitama usingSerious Punch Saitama usingOmnidirectional Serious Punch Saitama performsSerious Table Flip Keen Perception: Saitama has an uncanny ability to see through a person's facade and understand their deepest motivations for acting the way they do. He repeatedly proves this by reading people like Fubuki andGlasses. In a similar vein, he learns of King's deception quickly but opts to keep it to himself. Nonetheless, he excels at it only when he takes it seriously. He is also the first person to recognize Garou's inner turmoil and the fact that the Hero Hunter was always hoping to be a hero and not a monster.[citation\\u00a0needed] Power Control: Despite his overwhelming and immeasurable physical strength, Saitama has shown to have control over it. He can regulate the energy output of his punches, determining the exact amount of power he wants to exert. This control allows him to minimize collateral damage to the environment. In spite of being capable of effortlessly obliterating powerful Dragon-level Mysterious Beings,[62]and parting clouds across the entireplanetwith his punches,[93]Saitama can still deliver strikes with just enough force to incapacitate weaker opponents, such as humans or criminals, without causing severe or life-threatening injuries to them.[161] Saitama shattering Sonic's sword using his jaw Strong Teeth: In one of his fights with Sonic, the latter attacks him with a sword, which the Caped Baldy replies via biting and destroying said sword with no effort.[70] Strong Farts: In hisfightwith Garou, after getting a stomachache and being sent flying away, Saitama let out a strong fart that the propulsion from said flatulence gave him enough momentum to soon catch up to the Hero Hunter.[162] Intimidation: Even though he does not look scary at first glance, those aware of Saitama's power are afraid of him. Sonic and Genos were left amazed and frightened by Saitama's ability to emit a \\\"powerful aura,\\\" which made his opponents tremble and feel under pressure. When confronted by someone Saitama dislikes or finds annoying, all he has to do is threaten them with a few choice words, and they will cower in fear. Indomitable Will: Saitama has been shown to possess incredible willpower. It is most evident in the flashback to his hero training regime. Even if he was in great pain, or could barely move, or vomited blood, he continued his training.[163]Through sheer willpower and effort, Saitama removed his naturallimiterand became an invincible hero. In the original webcomic, Saitama's willpower is also evident in his fight with Tatsumaki. His strength of will is directly connected to his psychic resistance. Tatsumaki, the strongest knownesperin the universe, was unable to bend Saitama or lift him into space, exclaiming for the latter that he was \\\"too heavy\\\", although this was while she was injured.[130] Surfing Skills: Saitama has displayed the ability to balance an entireaircraft carrierand keep it stable as he surfs it down a gargantuan wave.[164] Saitama's rating determined by theHero Association[4]: Saitama's rating determined byGenos[165]:\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Personality\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Due to his great power and being virtually indestructible, Saitama is an indifferent person. Even the mightiest foes pose no challenge to him, so he does not take his hero work seriously, goes through everything with little to no effort, and yearns for an opponent that can provide him with a challenge.[29]The lack of worthy opponents has led him to suffer from a self-imposed existential crisis,[7]and he claims that his ability to feel any emotions has dulled considerably.[30]The combination of his attitude, unstoppable power, and \\\"unimpressive\\\" appearance often causes his battles to become anticlimactic. Saitama will usually allow his opponents to rant about their motives and power up into their strongest forms, before obliterating them with a single punch.[31] Saitama's indifferent expression after knowing people speaking ill of him Saitama's indifference doesn't rest solely on his hero work either. In daily life, he is often seen lounging around, playing video games, reading manga, or going out for strolls. His taste in food is rather plain, and he often frequents food stalls rather than going to restaurants or cooking at home. As his primary interest, hero work has become unfulfilling, and he pays little attention to anything else. A running gag about Saitama is his inability to remember people's faces and names, as seen when he forgotSpeed-o'-Sound Sonic's name,[32]or when he could not remember whoTanktop Tigerwas.[33]Because of this, he sometimes ends up pronouncing people's names incorrectly, much to their chagrin.[34]Saitama does not care if people insult him, and he usually ignores them and says that they need a hobby;[35]the only insult that could get a reaction out of him is anything about his lack of hair.[36][37]He has expressed distaste towards his officially assigned hero name, Caped Baldy. Thus, even after receiving it, he always refers to himself as Saitama. Saitama's reaction knowing he will miss a bargain sale Despite his indifference, Saitama can find things that interest him and actively looks for activities to relieve his boredom. These things tend to be mundane activities such as watching TV, shopping, or playing games. He shows a measure of concern when it comes to bargains and deals, as seen when he foughtCarnage Kabuto, where he was more shocked upon the realization that he was going to miss a bargain sale, rather than his opponent, who had undergone atransformationand was beating him around.[38] Saitama gets impatient with Genos' explanation He can also express irritation and even outright anger depending on the situation. However, Saitama has limited patience for long explanations and often interrupts the speaker.[39][40][41]His ideal word count is 20 or less.[39]He can get angry when he loses to someone like King when they play games. He will become enraged if anyone messes with his food or damages his home as he immediately killed a mantis monster for crashing through his roof and told Genos to move his fight with Sonic somewhere away from his apartment. Aside from being quite a cheapskate due to his financial status, he has a greedy side seen when he tried to steal bags of gold from the underground mine inside theMonster Association Headquartersand was visibly upset after accidentally dropping them down to the bottom of an underground ravine.[42] Despite his general indifference to most things, Saitama was genuinely shocked when he realized that no one knew of him despite his achievements, curious as to why he doesn't have any fans. This reaction demonstrates that while he isn't necessarily into hero work for fame, he certainly doesn't object to it.[43]Another running joke is Saitama's jealousy of higher rankings, such as when he grew irritated whenGenoslisted off all of the comments made by fans about how amazing Genos is in their eyes. Beneath the surface, Saitama is much more complex than his appearance and attitude suggest. While he scored low on the written portion of the hero exam, he is, by no means, unintelligent. Saitama is very observant, insightful, and has high tactical awareness. This is seen in how he could easily discern situations and character traits from the people and environment around him. He could pick up several hints about Sonic's persona upon their first meeting.[44]When two tank top heroes jealously plotted to ruin him after themeteor event, he remarked that there were irate and self-serving hero types like them. He was even able to discernFubuki's forced offer of submission or destruction just before his crackdown on how the hero world really works than how it is currently run.[45]Saitama has shown remorse to his enemies before, particularly those who can give him a stimulating fight and don't just go down in one hit. One such example of this isBoros, the self-claimed \\\"Dominator of the Universe\\\", with whom Saitama sympathized due to suffering from similar circumstances, though, in the end, even Boros still could not draw out Saitama's full power.[46] Saitama tends to come off as abrasive to others and often is inconsiderate of their feelings or how his words affect them. That isn't to say he is intentionally malicious or rude, but rather that his indifference extends to his social interactions. He reacted to Fubuki greeting him as the number 1 B-Class heroine with a quick acknowledgement but seemed otherwise unimpressed frustrating Fubuki. He also downplays the gravity of situations based on his own perspective rather than that of others, never considering that those without his earth-shattering power would be rightly more horrified in extreme cases like Boros threatening to destroy the world or the monster society declaring open war on humanity. During his fight with Garou, Saitama initially displayed his unconcerned attitude against the Human Monster, from playful banter to compliments on Garou's capability. Saitama turning the civilians against him Despite his aloof, carefree, and uninterested personality, Saitama is actually one of the most morally upright heroes in the story. While many other heroes only care about personal achievements so they can rank up in order to gain more fame and popularity, Saitama is very humble, as he purposefully let the masses turn against him in order for the defeated heroes to be given credit for their efforts against theDeep Sea King, even claiming that they had weakened the monster before his arrival wanting to give credit to the heroes that were actually risking their lives to protect innocent people.[47]Saitama did the same for thepolice station, killing a monster while disguised as apolice officer, despite potentially gaining much fame had he revealed who he actually was as he heard the Hero Association executive try to force the police to beg for assistance exclaiming that, \\\"Police and heroes don't help people because someone had to beg\\\".[48]This is also his outlook on being a hero as he told Genos, \\\"If heroes run and hide, who will stand and fight\\\". He also did not mind thatKingtook credit for all of his achievements.[49]One of the most understated signs of Saitama's high morality is that he never uses his incredible strength for evil, even though no one can stop him from doing whatever he wants. Saitama telling Genos he's gotten stronger Although he may initially rub people the wrong way and seldom shows his emotions to others, it doesn't mean Saitama doesn't show care for the people around him or their physical or mental well-being. On some occasions, he's helped people with their mental issues, such as a suicidal man wanting to jump off a building,[50]and giving words of encouragement to Fubuki about how she should not seek the approval of others but live her life how she wanted.[51]He promisedTareoto stop Garou without killing him,[52]and complemented Genos after the cyborg saved Tatsumaki by claiming that his heart had grown stronger.[53] While he has no problem killing monsters, Saitama has yet to be seen killing anotherhumanand only ever uses enough strength to knock them out. His restraint is so ingrained that no matter the opponent's power and no matter how much Saitama knows about them, he only kills when he intends to kill, even if he hits someone unexpectedly, such as the number of times he's knocked out Garou. Saitama exhibiting a somber demeanor following Genos' death in the Ominous Future In theOminous Future, after the devastating deaths of Genos and numerous other heroes at the hands of Garou, Saitama becomes despondent. He begins questioning his abilities and intuition as a hero, lamenting that he tends to arrive too late to prevent such tragic outcomes. Quickly, this changes into a state of tranquil anger, where he decides to no longer hold back against Garou. The death of Genos also causes Saitama to lose any potential excitement at facing the Hero Hunter, despite considering Garou a strong opponent who may provide him with a challenging fight, showing his depression at his disciple's end.[54]In spite of his anger towards Garou for his cruel doings, at the end of their fight, Saitama recalls his promise to Tareo about not killing Garou (or he has always kept it in mind during the fight). He eventually calms down and reverts to his casual, relaxed demeanor, complying with the Hero Hunter's request to teach him a time travel technique. Garou later comments that individuals of such immense power as himself and Saitama require the presence of others to act as anchors, to help them maintain their sanity - the sense of isolation that accompanies such unparalleled strength can be enough to drive even the most powerful beings to the brink of madness.[55] Saitama motivates Glasses to become stronger Saitama has proven to be a good figure to other people, both heroes and villains alike. His influence made Genos quit his revenge wishes and start focusing on training to become a good and strong hero.[56][57]He has also made insecure people like Fubuki andGlassesstand up to their challenges and become better heroes.[58]Saitama also advises King to train and become strong for real, rather than being upset the latter stole credit from his battles.[59] As Genos notes, Saitama \\\"attracts the strong\\\", as many powerful heroes and villains have taken a liking to him.[60]This is due to his lack of interest in hero ranking and fame that attracts them.[61] Saitama is the titularOne-Punch Manand the strongest character in the series. So far, no enemy has been able to injure him in any way, and almost no enemy has been able to survive a single earnest punch from him. A few enemies havesurvivedpunches from him, such as any human he has struck (whom he restrains himself against) and Boros, whom Saitama empathized with and held back against so as to give himself and Boros a satisfying and stimulating fight.

His punches are so powerful that many monsters simply explode when struck. An example of this casual yet overwhelming offensive power occurs when Saitama launches himself from the top of a building, blasts right through a giantmeteorwith a punch, lands safely, and calmly decides to go home.[69]Another instance is when Sonic tries to attack Saitama with a sword; he stops the sword by catching it with his teeth, effortlessly shattering the blade with the power of his jaw.[70]When launched fromEarthto the moon by Boros, he used his jumping power to return to Earth in mere moments, causing a huge shockwave and leaving a massive crater on the surface of the moon upon departure.[71]A \\\"normal\\\" punch from him was shown to be highly destructive, even to someone as durable as Boros.[72]A \\\"serious\\\" punch from him was able to counter the latter's strongest attack,Collapsing Star Roaring Cannon, an attack capable of destroying the planet or its surface. Not only did Saitama completely negate Boros' final attack using his serious punch, but the shockwave from the punch was also powerful enough to part clouds on a global scale.[73]When fightingOrochi, the high-speed pressure of the lava fired from his hands was enough to overpower and completely disperse Orochi'sGaia Cannon, an incredibly powerful attack that drew energy from the Earth's core and caused worldwide earthquakes.[74]Additionally, he is capable of destroying the Earth if he wanted to,[75]and has threatened to do so when irritated.[76]His strength has been stated by numerous characters to defy reason.[77][78][79] Saitama dispersing Jupiter's gases with a sneeze With only one hand, Saitama could lift the entire surface ofIo, a moon ofJupiter, launching its wreckage intospace.[80]In his fight againstCosmic Fear ModeGarou, whose copying powers allowed him to wield Saitama's strength himself, a collision between twoSerious Punches from them produced aSerious Punch\\u00b2that resulted in immensely powerful waves of energy able to destroy the Earth. After being diverted by Blast and his allies, the compressed energy from the collision further travelled into outer space before exploding and presumably destroying numerousstar systemsin the far distance, leaving a massive hole of starless-darkness in the cosmos.[81]In the climax of the fight against Garou on Io, Saitama was able to accidentally blow away half the gas of Jupiter, the largest planet in the solar system, with aSerious Sneeze.[82] Saitama jumps off the moon Saitama dodging Genos's attack Unparalleled Speed and Reflexes: Saitama possesses unparalleled speed and reflexes. He was able to complete a 1500-meter dash in an instant during his hero tryouts.[88]He has proven able to effortlessly outpaceSpeed-o'-Sound Sonic, a ninja whose specialty is his superspeed.[89][90]Even Genos's computerized targeting systems have difficulty tracking him.[91]He once ran down a building to save a piece of salmon he was having for lunch, and leap back up said building without bystanders noticing he had even done so.[50]His speed is so impressive that he can outpaceFlashy Flash, an S-Class hero well-known for his extraordinary speed, easily dodging and catching his sword swings.[92]When kicked to the moon by Boros, he quickly made a jump back to Earth, demonstrating the ability to travel at high-speeds.[93]In addition, he was capable of easily reacting to and blocking rocks thrown at near-lightspeed byGeryuganshoop,[94]the speed of which being like a bad joke to him.[95] Saitama travelling across a moon at incredibly high speeds In hisfightagainst evolved monster Garou, Saitama proved himself firmly superior to and able to effortlessly keep up with him, despite the Hero Hunter previously being capable of creating a giant light structure alongsidePlatinum Spermin only 1.3 milliseconds (0.0013 seconds) through sheer speed.[96][97][98]On Io, one ofJupiter's moons, after flipping a large amount of ground into the air with hisSerious Table Flip, he was capable of covering immensely huge distances by dashing across tons of rubble, having jumped around the natural satellite so fast that a large constellation was created from his sheer speed.[99]Ironically, despite his incomparable reflexes and speed, he still has problems squashing a simple mosquito.[100] During a training day when he still had hair, Saitama attempted to quickly turn his head to see the back of it in a mirror. Although he failed at first, in the end, he supposedly managed to glimpse the back of his head.[101]It is likely that achieving this would require him to move his head at a speed approaching that of light, along with having reflexes and reaction times as quick, ensuring that the reflected image in the mirror would not have enough time to change significantly before his eyes could perceive it, so to speak. Saitama creating countless afterimages Superhuman Stamina and Endurance: After becoming too powerful from his training regimen, Saitama has no longer been shown to tire out when fighting enemies. The only time he was shown to be panting and out of breath from continuous running, he recovered just seconds later.[110]He could still suppress pain even before gaining his overwhelming power.[111][112]This has been shown on numerous occasions dating back to his days as a middle school student, taking a beating from two upper-level students and, laterPiggy Bancon, a Wolf-level threat. Saitama then got back up when the bullies could not and chased after the pig-like monster for his money.[113]Other similar feats include enduring strikes fromCrablanteandPersonification Of A Light Pull Cordduring his training as an adult among others. Superhuman Eyesight: Saitama's eyesight is superhuman; after being kicked to the Moon by Boros, he could see, pinpoint the location of thegiant spaceship, and land back on it from the lunar distance.[93]His tracking capability is also astonishing, as he can concentrate on a fast-moving object for a long time and still not lose sight of it, as seen when he was the only person to see where Garou escaped to.[114][115]He is also able to see in the dark, as he was able to spot a kid a great distance away during the night.[116] Invulnerability: Saitama possesses unparalleled toughness and durability, being able to withstand attacks from even the most powerfulMysterious Beingswithout the slightest damage.[117]In fact, no character has actually been able to damage, or even physically harm Saitama in any way. When Genos created a huge, spherical blast of flame to killMosquito Girl's mosquitoes, Saitama remained standing right next to him completely unharmed (though his clothes were burnt).[118]Another testament to his astonishing durability is that Garou, who, despite having gained enormous strength from monsterization, still could not inflict even the slightest damage on Saitama during their fight.[96][97]Notably, he was capable of withstanding Garou'sExtreme Fa Jin, an attack powerful enough to raise a large landmass on the other side of the planet, without any injury.[98]When facing a Garou who became influenced by \\\"God\\\", a mysterious entity possessing frightening supernatural powers, Saitama sustained multiple nuclear explosions generated by the Hero Hunter point-blank without any physical harm.[119]Even after taking Garou's Gamma Ray Burst head-on, narratively described as the same phenomenon as agamma ray burst, the most powerful type of explosion known in the universe, he emerged unscathed.[120]Despite Garou utilizing hisMode: Saitama, a supernatural mimicry ability, to harness Saitama's striking power and hit him with it, he could still withstand the assault without noticeable damage.[121] Saitama prefers to dodge or block attacks using edged weapons,[122][123]rather than take them head-on, as he sometimes does with strikes from fists or blunt objects. However,Nyan's powerful claws, which can cut buildings into pieces, were shown unable to affect Saitama's head, indicating his remarkable resistance to piercing damage as well.[124]Additionally, Garou'sWhirlwind Iron Cutting Fistcould only destroy Saitama's clothing without cutting the skin underneath.[125]When being shot by machine guns from Bofoi's highly advanced robots, the bullets bounced harmlessly off his skin. Saitama submerging in lava with no problem Saitama holding his breath on the moon with no difficulty Vacuum Adaptation: Saitama has remarkable control over his breath, demonstrated by his ability to effortlessly hold it even in outer space. He managed to jump from the Moon back to Earth in seconds without showing any signs of suffocation,[131]despite the lack of atmosphere and increased radiation exposure.[132]His body has been shown to adapt to and withstand extraterrestrial environments where oxygen is scarce or absent. For instance, during his battle with Garou on Io, one of Jupiter's moons, he showed no adverse effects from the thin and unbreathable atmosphere there.[133]These feats, along with his exceptional resistance to cosmic radiation and superhuman endurance, suggest that Saitama has the capability to endure the harsh environmental conditions ofouter spaceas well, at least for a decent period of time. Accelerated Development: After almost a year of following his training regimen, Saitama realized that his body had adapted to move with the prowess befitting a true hero that he imagined.[112]As a consequence, his power started to skyrocket at a rapid pace. In a short period, he achieved unparalleled levels of physical abilities, a testament to his extraordinary growth rate. In his fight with Garou onIo, Saitama's growth rate began to soar exponentially due to the intense emotions coursing through him.[121] Saitama enters Phoenix Space, a spiritual space Non-Physical Interaction: Saitama was capable of separating his consciousness from his body to intrude on thePhoenix Space, a mental space that only exists withinPhoenix Man's bird costume, and breaking a hole into it, much to the latter's confusion.[134]Before entering, he could somehow sense thatChild Emperorand Phoenix Man were having a conversation inside the aforementioned spiritual space, and he mistakenly thought that they were talking about his head. After leaving the Phoenix Space, Saitama's consciousness simply returned to his physical body in the same way as Child Emperor's and Phoenix Man's did.[135] Mimicry: Saitama possesses the remarkable ability to learn and replicate other techniques just by witnessing them once. Similarly to Garou, he can not only copy techniques, but also improve upon them. The sheer extent that this mimicry prowess displays is remarkably exceptional, as he was even able to copy Garou's ability to travel through time.[121] Saitama traveling through time Master Hand-to-Hand Combatant: Thanks to many fights with monsters and villains during his training, Saitama has gained a fair amount of fighting experience. Due to his immeasurable power and the resulting boredom, he usually does not focus on technique and relies on basic attacks. Unlikemartial artists, his fighting style is simple but solid, bolstered by his absolute strength. Garou comments that Saitama is an amateur fighter and has many openings to exploit. However, in hisfightagainst Garou onIo, it becomes evident that he is an exceptionally quick learner, capable of mastering any martial arts techniques after observing them only once. Nevertheless, at the end of the day, he chooses to remain a brawler, favoring simple but powerful punches over martial arts. For him, the simplicity of being a brawler is more appealing than mastering complex techniques, as his raw power and speed are more than sufficient to overwhelm his opponents. Saitama also uses karate chops,[138]and grappling moves to take down villains he doesn't want to kill, or just to knock out people who pick on him. Improvisation: Saitama is very proficient with improvised weapons, such as when he killed hisfirst monsterby deftly using his tie to grab the monster's eye and tear out his intestines. He is proficient at improvising in general; whenever he can't solve a fight with a punch or directly can't punch his foe, he always comes up with a solution in one way or another and uses unique moves supported by his immeasurable power. Some of these instances are with hisSerious Table Flip,[139][140]and hisSerious Headbutt.[141] Supernatural Accuracy: Saitama seems to have almost perfect precision since whenever he focuses on a target, he always strikes it. He can turn a rock into a deadly projectile that hits its target, as shown when he killed Geryuganshoop. He also had no trouble landing directly on Boros's ship from the moon, even though the angle to return to Earth was extremely small, leaving little room for error. Normal Series: Saitama's Normal Series consists of techniques in which he puts very little effort into attacking. Even though his attacks are loose in this style, most opponents tend to be finished off easily due to Saitama's tremendous strength and speed. Saitama usingConsecutive Normal Punches Killer Move: Serious Series(\\u5fc5\\u6bba\\u30de\\u30b8\\u30b7\\u30ea\\u30fc\\u30ba,Hissatsu Majishir\\u012bzu): In Serious Series, Saitama puts more effort into his attacks. His face looks more serious when he performs these \\\"serious\\\" attacks. Despite the incredible strength behind them, Saitama does not actually consider these moves to be anything special.[147] Saitama usingSerious Punch Saitama usingOmnidirectional Serious Punch Saitama performsSerious Table Flip Keen Perception: Saitama has an uncanny ability to see through a person's facade and understand their deepest motivations for acting the way they do. He repeatedly proves this by reading people like Fubuki andGlasses. In a similar vein, he learns of King's deception quickly but opts to keep it to himself. Nonetheless, he excels at it only when he takes it seriously. He is also the first person to recognize Garou's inner turmoil and the fact that the Hero Hunter was always hoping to be a hero and not a monster.[citation\\u00a0needed] Power Control: Despite his overwhelming and immeasurable physical strength, Saitama has shown to have control over it. He can regulate the energy output of his punches, determining the exact amount of power he wants to exert. This control allows him to minimize collateral damage to the environment. In spite of being capable of effortlessly obliterating powerful Dragon-level Mysterious Beings,[62]and parting clouds across the entireplanetwith his punches,[93]Saitama can still deliver strikes with just enough force to incapacitate weaker opponents, such as humans or criminals, without causing severe or life-threatening injuries to them.[161] Saitama shattering Sonic's sword using his jaw Strong Teeth: In one of his fights with Sonic, the latter attacks him with a sword, which the Caped Baldy replies via biting and destroying said sword with no effort.[70] Strong Farts: In hisfightwith Garou, after getting a stomachache and being sent flying away, Saitama let out a strong fart that the propulsion from said flatulence gave him enough momentum to soon catch up to the Hero Hunter.[162] Intimidation: Even though he does not look scary at first glance, those aware of Saitama's power are afraid of him. Sonic and Genos were left amazed and frightened by Saitama's ability to emit a \\\"powerful aura,\\\" which made his opponents tremble and feel under pressure. When confronted by someone Saitama dislikes or finds annoying, all he has to do is threaten them with a few choice words, and they will cower in fear. Indomitable Will: Saitama has been shown to possess incredible willpower. It is most evident in the flashback to his hero training regime. Even if he was in great pain, or could barely move, or vomited blood, he continued his training.[163]Through sheer willpower and effort, Saitama removed his naturallimiterand became an invincible hero. In the original webcomic, Saitama's willpower is also evident in his fight with Tatsumaki. His strength of will is directly connected to his psychic resistance. Tatsumaki, the strongest knownesperin the universe, was unable to bend Saitama or lift him into space, exclaiming for the latter that he was \\\"too heavy\\\", although this was while she was injured.[130] Surfing Skills: Saitama has displayed the ability to balance an entireaircraft carrierand keep it stable as he surfs it down a gargantuan wave.[164] Saitama's rating determined by theHero Association[4]: Saitama's rating determined byGenos[165]:\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Abilities and Powers\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The origin of Saitama's immense strength is mysterious and unclear. Although he tells everyone he got his incredible power through mere physical training, no one believes him at all.[63]According to Saitama, after a year and a half of 100 daily push-ups, sit-ups, and squats, plus 10 km daily running, he had achieved some level of superhuman strength.[63]This training was apparently so intense for Saitama that he at times felt he might die, and claims that it is what caused all of his hair to suddenly and eventually fall out.[63]Genos believes that Saitama himself does not actually know or understand how he gained his power, and hopes to learn the secret by sparring with and observing him,[64]whileDr. Genusbelieves that Saitama worked out with said training regimen so hard that he had removed hislimiter.[65]It should be noted that Saitama would complete all parts of the training one after the other without breaks and was battling monsters that appeared during that time, which would have made completing the training more intense than it would normally be expected. Genos beating Saitama in an eating contest Despite his unbelievable physical prowess, Saitama can be outperformed by people with skills in areas outside fighting, like when he was bested byBangin a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors or defeated byKingin video games, mostly in one-sided matches.[66][67]Furthermore, he also seems to possess a normal human appetite, as he lost to Genos in a spicy noodle eating contest.[68] Saitama displays overwhelming strength in his punches Unparalleled Strength: Saitama possesses seemingly limitless physical strength and is capable of effortlessly defeating powerful monsters and villains with a single, casual punch (although this strength is not limited to punches).

Her designs are great and very cute. While she isn't really a fighter, she still puts up a good fight whenever she does battle. LikeTsunade, Konan, Chiyo, etc., she is one of the few well-written female characters in the series. Even though she is rather kindhearted and tender, she does have some really scary moments, most notably in the Boruto series. By Part II of the anime, Hinata's control of her chakra has advanced enough to match a medical-nin's, for which reason she is assigned to help perform the Four-Corner Sealing Barrier. During the Chunin Exams, she allowed Naruto to cheat on her test, however he declined. During Naruto's fight with Kiba, Hinata's loyalties are torn; she wants to cheer for Naruto, but fears that would be rude to Kiba. After said fight, she gave some healing ointment to both Naruto and Kiba so their wounds can heal faster. While she was badly injured and almost killed after her fight with Neji, she still put up a great fight against him, and it showed us that she isn't the useless type of girl. She, along with Sakura, Ino, Kiba, Izumo and a few others were some of the few people to cheer for Naruto during his fight against Neji. During a filler arc, she went off by herself and trained by a waterfall in order to create a new jutsu, which later turned out to be the 8 Trigrams 64 Palms. Before Naruto returned to the village from training, during a second Chunin Exams, she became a Chunin along with her team. In thePain's Assaultarc, when Naruto was impaled and pinned down by Pain's chakra rods, rendering him immobile, she attempted to protect him while fighting Pain, knowing that she doesn't stand a chance and might die fighting Pain, but just wanted to protect Naruto when no one else did and puts her life on the line. The scene where she confesses her feelings to Naruto is one of the most emotional/heartwarming moments in the series due to how much she loves Naruto and is willing to sacrifice herself to protect him. Although she gets overpowered and defeated by Pain, this act from Hinata would pave the way of Naruto's victory over Pain. During the Fourth Great Shinobi War, after Neji collapsed from exhaustion, she took responsibility for monitoring the Second Division's perimeter with her Byakugan When Neji sacrificed his life to protect Naruto and Hinata from the Ten-Tailed Beast, Obito taunts Naruto with his speech that if he keeps resisting, all of his friends will share the same fate as Neji, making Naruto nearly lost all hope and join Obito to stop further bloodshed, but Hinata prevented Naruto from joining Obito and encourages him to not give up and to not let Neji's death be in vain, which motivates Naruto to continue fighting and share his chakra with everyone. With her Byakugan, she saw the Ten-Tails being absorbed into Obito, meaning he has become its jinchuriki, and informed Sakura and the Alliance about it. During the Last, she decided to confess her feelings for Naruto by knitting a scarf for him, a replacement for the damaged one he gave her when they were children. Later in the movie, she gave the finished scarf to Naruto with her goodbyes and leaves with Toneri. While this seemed like she was marrying him, it turned out to be a plan to get closer to Hanabi, who has been kidnapped by him. Later on, she tried to reason with Toneri that Hamura never wished to destroy earth, but he doesn't listen. Then, Hinata attempts to destroy the Tenseigan Altar as per Hamura\\u2019s request only to be stopped by Toneri, after which he destroys the new scarf, that is actually meant for Naruto, and places her under his control. After being placed inside a picture frame, she shed a tear over her regret about \\\"betraying\\\" Naruto. When Naruto released her from Toneri's control, at which point she apologized to him for her earlier behavior, though he states he already understands and forgives her. In Boruto, she became a great mother, heck, she almost sacrificed herself to save Naruto when he was kidnapped by Momoshiki.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Personality\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Her act of fainting when she sees Naruto can be repetitive to some people.

But even at a young age, her father came to believe that Hinata was not suited for the role of heiress, as she struggled under his gruesome training regime, on top of him also believing that her timid personality prevented her from truly excelling. When Hinata's younger sisterHanabistarted displaying superior talent, Hiashi began to reconsider Hinata's selection as heiress. In the anime, Hinata and Hanabi were pitted against each other to determine who would one day lead the Hy\\u016bga. Because Hinata was unwilling to harm Hanabi - a hesitation Hanabi did not share - she was defeated, disappointing her father.[10]Hinata was then disinherited and turned over to the care ofKurenai Y\\u016bhi.[11] Hinata meets Naruto. On the day of her enrolment in Konoha'sAcademy,[12]Hinata was picked on by three bullies because of herunusual eyes. Naruto, despite not knowing her, immediately came to her defence, but he was outnumbered and knocked unconscious, and the bullies damaged the red scarf he was wearing. When he regained consciousness, Hinata thanked him for helping her and returned his scarf to him, but he let her keep it. Hinata started watching Naruto from that point onwards, and by doing so saw Naruto's desire to gain attention and his struggle to exceed the extremely low expectations others had for him. Despite this, Naruto never lost faith in himself or his dream to become theHokage. Hinata was inspired by this and started emulating Naruto, adopting his refusal to never give up as a means of earning her father's approval. In the anime, Hinata's growing affections for Naruto were noticed by the Hy\\u016bga's elders, who warned her to stay away from him.[13] As a child, Hinata was soft-spoken and polite, always addressing people with properhonourifics. She is kind, always thinking of others more than for herself, caring for their feelings and well-being. She doesn't like being confrontational for any reason. This led to her being meek or timid to others, as her overwhelming kindness can render her unable to respond or act for fear of offending somebody.[14]Her father's constant push to alter this personality trait when she was younger only made it worse, eroding Hinata's self-confidence and making her even more bashful because she gained so little faith in herself and opinions.[3]Despite being disinherited, Hinata loves her family very much, as shown when she \\\"agreed\\\" to marry Toneri in order to rescue Hanabi even though she knew it meant breaking Naruto's heart and the possibility she and Toneri actually would get married. Hinata's outlook sees a shift after her appointment to Team 8. Whereas her father and much of the Hy\\u016bga clan had decided she was a lost cause who would never amount to anything,[15]her team considers her a valuable member with her special strong points. Originally, she would over-rely on her teammates, looking to them in times of difficulty to save her from situations that make her uncomfortable. It is for her teammates - among other reasons - that Hinata starts seeking to change herself, as she wishes to help the team rather than burden it.[16] Hinata dreams of being with Naruto. Hinata's primary motivation is Naruto Uzumaki, with whom she has been fascinated since meeting him. He initially gained her attention because of his kindness to her and outspoken nature, and then kept her attention because of similarities that Hinata perceived to herself: Naruto had a painful childhood without the love of parents, a fate worse than the mere difficulty she had with her own father, and he craves the attention and acknowledgement of anybody, just as Hinata wants to please her father.[17]But whereas Hinata lost faith in herself, Naruto always believed he can accomplish any given task if he tries hard enough. She admires him deeply for this courage and over time fell deeply in love with him, which manifests as increased shyness and speechlessness when around him, something that became apparent to everyone, apart from ironically Naruto himself. Hinata strives to prove herself to others, but mostly to gain the attention and worthiness of Naruto. She emulates him to this purpose, adopting hisnind\\u014dof never giving up to improve herself. To that end, she stops running from confrontation, instead doing all that she can to face it, even in the face of failure to keep trying, and willing to risk her life for her loved ones and village.[18]By the end of Part I, her clan's faith in her is restored and strengthened.[19] Hinata's intimidating demeanour. Throughout the years, Naruto remains her primary motivation; she willingly faced Pain to protect Naruto, despite knowing she has no chance of winning.[20]She even defends Naruto from himself when he's in doubt, repeating to him his refusal to never give up.[21]Two yearsafter the war, upon achieving hergreatest dreamof having her love reciprocated by Naruto to form a deep and committed relationship together, she became more expressive about her feelings. In the anime, she is able to laugh openly because of it.[22]After marrying Naruto and he becomes Hokage, Hinata remains supportive of him and his increased responsibilities, even though she yearns for him to be home more often. As a mother and wife, she has become a master homemaker, keeping the family well-structured yet well-adjusted and happy. While very loving and supportive of her family, she is equally strict and assertive. Her newfound structured nature made her very intimidating and more easily angered when her family acts up, easily keeping them in line and swiftly punishing them for their misconduct.[23][8]She is also insightful and wise with her words, realising that her children, particularly Boruto, take after Naruto in the desire to prove themselves to others and that she must believe in them to do things on their own.[24] Hinata is a slender girl of fair-complexion who, as a Hy\\u016bga, her most distinguishing trait is theByakugan, giving her featureless white eyes (lavender in the anime). She has dark blue hair that she keeps in a bob-cut of different lengths: in Part I, her hair is cut just above her forehead akin to a bowl-cut with chin-length strands framing her face; in Part II, her hair reaches her lower back and the framing strands reach shoulder-length; inThe Last: Naruto the Movie, her hair extends beyond her hips and she would at times tie it into a ponytail. By the time Boruto entered the Academy, she cut it into a bob-style reaching her shoulders.[25]She is noted to be beautiful by Naruto[12]andToneri \\u014ctsutsuki. In Part I, Hinata usually wears a cream-coloured hooded-jacket with a fire symbol on the upper sleeves and fur around the cuffs and hem. She also wears navy blue pants and keeps herforehead protectorloosely around her neck. In Part II, she dons a lavender and cream hooded-jacket with lavender cuffs over mesh armour. She also wears navy blue pants, black, low-heeled sandals, and changes the cloth of her forehead protector from blue to black. Hinata switches to the standard Konoha infantryflak jacketand assorted clothing during the Fourth Shinobi World War, though she does not appear to wear a forehead protector. Two years after the war, Hinata's mission attire is a form-fitting light lavender, sleeveless kimono-style blouse with vertical lines, tied with a dark purple obi around her waist and short dark navy shorts. She also wore thigh-high stockings with black, open-toed boots. She does not wear her forehead protector at all. Her outfits become more varied after that, changing to match the occasion or simply being more casual than her prior garb. During Hinata's and Toneri's wedding, she wore a wide black and grey top with a long grey sash around her waist. She also wore short puffy pants with black lace socks and sandals. On her head was a black turban with a black and light yellow veil over and yellow crescent moon earrings. During Hinata's and Naruto's wedding, she wore a traditional white kimono with a flower in her hair. After getting married, she consistently wears a light purple short-sleeved jacket, a long-sleeved white shirt with a two pink coloured strips underneath it, light brown shorts and purple open-toed boots. In theBorutomanga, Hinata has a necklace with the Uzumaki symbol on it. She also wears her wedding ring on her left hand and has her hair cut into a short bob style with fringes covering the top of her forehead. Hinata repelling a Ten-Tails mini-clone with the Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms. Originally, Hinata's gentle personality hindered her performance, to which she was deemed too weak and unworthy for the role of heir.[26]After committing herself getting stronger in her training for Naruto, receiving consistent praise from her team and clan for her improving skills and strengthening character.[27][20][18]Two years after the war, Hinata, having been recognised byHamura \\u014ctsutsukias the Byakugan Princess, proves to be crucial in the destruction of theTenseigan, even though she herself can't destroy it.[7] Over a decade later, while rusty as she retired to be a housewife, Hinata's prowess still remained formidable. Despite being unprepared and reluctant to fight Hanabi, an active j\\u014dnin who continues training to become the next Hy\\u016bga clan leader, Hinata decisively defeated her sister in a match.[28] Hinata's Gentle Step: Twin Lion Fist using Hamura's chakra. From her special clan training, Hinata has advanced control of her chakra. In the anime, Hinata's additional training during Part I resulted in her ability to free herself from contraints[29]and manipulate nearby water sources, turning them intoprojectiles.[30]By Part II of the anime, Hinata's control has advanced enough to match amedical-nin's, for which reason she is assigned to help perform theFour-Corner Sealing Barrier. When she met Hamura, Hinata inherited some of hischakrabecause she is a member of the Hy\\u016bga clan's main house. It is the strength and purity of her chakra that attractsToneri \\u014ctsutsuki. It is also because of her being the member of the Hy\\u016bga clan's main house and direct bloodline from Hamura that she can touch and find the Tenseigan, though she can't destroy it by herself, so instead she held Naruto's hand to give him allowance to touch the Tenseigan and for him to destroy it, since anyone without the Hy\\u016bga and\\u014ctsutsukibloodline can't touch it. Hinata's Byakugan. As a Hy\\u016bga, Hinata possesses the Byakugan, ad\\u014djutsuthat grants her penetrative vision in a near-360\\u00b0 around herself, with one blind spot at the back of the neck above the firstthoracic vertebra.[31]With it, she is able to assist others frequently in tracking, scouting the area for their target(s); by focusing her vision in a single direction, Hinata can see across vast distances, able to see at least 1 kilometre during her first Ch\\u016bnin Exam, and reaching as far away as 20 kilometres by the battle against Toneri. Hinata's Byakugan grants her attacks pinpoint accuracy, which she can share with others to also improve their own.[32]She can also use it in order to identifygenjutsu, searching for the caster in the nearby area.[33]In the anime, Hinata can useinfraredvision and magnify in to see tiny targets.[34]By adulthood, the chakra sensitivity provided by the Byakugan allows her to pick up on the slightest presence of chakra.[35] As is traditional in her clan, Hinata has been extensively trained in theGentle Fistfighting style. In unison with her Byakugan, Hinata can attack accurately target an individuals'chakra pathway systemsand the 361tenketsuthat run along it, constricting or cutting off their chakra flow from only minimal contact.[15]Although this enables Hinata to attack an opponent's internal organs, she can also use it in a supplementary function, such as by setting dislocated shoulders back in place.[36] Hinata and Neji combining their Eight Trigrams Vacuum Palms. While Hinata hadn't yet mastered her clan's most advanced techniques in Part I, in the anime, she created theProtecting Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palmsas an alternative, which effectively protects her and attacks anything within range with sharp streams of chakra emitted from her palms.[37]By Part II, she had grown accustomed to more of her clan's techniques. During Pain's Assault, Hinata could use theGentle Step Twin Lion Fists, a technique that drains the target of their chakra where struck. During the Fourth Shinobi World War, Hinata could use theEight Trigrams Vacuum Palmto attack targets outside her physical range or deflect incoming attacks,[38]which increases in power if used inconjunction with others.[39]She also mastered theEight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palmsin the war.[40]By the time she reaches adulthood, she became well-known for her mastery of the Gentle Fist.[41]As an adult, she could even knock out a target with a single strike to their tenketsu.[42][43]Hinata is also proven to be very resilient, having survived an assault by Momoshiki \\u014ctsutsuki. While Hinata doesn't usually useninjutsu, by the Fourth Shinobi World War, hernature transformationsincludedFireandLightning Release.[4]In the anime, she also demonstrated proficiency inmedical ninjutsu, able to use theMystical Palm Techniqueto heal the wounded.[44] Main article:Prologue \\u2014 Land of WavesIn the anime, while the graduates of herAcademyclass are being assigned to teams, Hinata hopes that she will be on the same team asNaruto Uzumaki. To her disappointment, she is instead added toKurenai Y\\u016bhi'sTeam 8, along withKiba InuzukaandShino Aburame. Kurenai reports this to Hinata's father,Hiashi Hy\\u016bga, but he is unconcerned and in fact abandons Hinata to Kurenai's care, feeling she is unworthy of theHy\\u016bga clan.[15] Main article:Ch\\u016bnin Exams Hinata lets Naruto copy her test. Despite how recently they graduated from the Academy, Kurenai enters Team 8 in theCh\\u016bnin Examsbeing held inKonoha; Hinata agrees to participate because she wants to change herself. For the exams' first stage, Hinata is seated next to Naruto as they take a written test. The objective in the first stage is to cheat off of other examinee's paper without getting caught, but Naruto doesn't realise this and agonises about potentially failing. Seeing this, Hinata offers to let him copy off of her paper. He suspects she's trying to trick him, but she assures him that she only wants to be helpful. Although he considers taking her up on her offer, Naruto ultimately declines, fearing that he'll get her disqualified if they're caught and claiming that, besides, he isn't the type to cheat. Although Naruto is given the opportunity to forfeit, he refuses to do so, and for his determination, he passes the first stage along with Hinata and their teams. For the second stage, participants enter theForest of Deathwith the objective of obtaining a set of two scrolls, one of which they are given at the start. Team 8 manages to collect their second scroll right after the second stage has started, and so they head for the centre of the forest where they're supposed to turn in the scrolls. Along the way, Kiba's partner,Akamaru, senses theThree Sand Siblings' fight withTeam Shigure. Team 8 watches the fight from the cover of some nearby bushes and is horrified whenGaaramercilessly kills all of Team Shigure. After they're certain Gaara won't kill them too, they proceed to the centre of the forest. After passing the second stage, the remaining participants take part in one-on-one preliminary matches. During Naruto's fight with Kiba, Hinata's loyalties are torn; she wants to cheer for Naruto, but fears that would be rude to Kiba. When Naruto wins the fight, Hinata gives both him and Kiba some of theHy\\u016bga Clan Secret Ointmentso that their wounds will heal faster. As he's being taken away to rest, Kiba pleads for Hinata to forfeit if she's matched against Gaara or her cousin,Neji Hy\\u016bga. She is indeed matched against the latter, a member of a Hy\\u016bga clan branch house who hates all members of the main house. Neji, like Kiba, tries to convince Hinata to forfeit, telling her that she's too meek and insecure to be a ninja. She begins to offer arguments in her defence, but Neji persists, claiming that she is fated to be a failure, a fact that he believes she's aware of due to her frightened reaction to what he says. Hinata fights Neji. Neji's words cause Hinata to cry, but also anger the watching Naruto, who insists that Hinata can change herself if she wants to and who encourages her to defeat Neji. Because Naruto has faith in her, Hinata refuses to forfeit and prepares to fight; Neji is surprised by the new confidence in her. Hinata and Neji exchangeGentle Fist-blows, but only Neji's are effective, which he reveals to be because he sealed hertenketsuat the start of their fight. Although her attacks are ineffective against him, Hinata continues fighting, in the process enduring mounting internal trauma from Neji's counterattacks. Neji repeatedly tells her to forfeit, but Hinata refuses, unwilling to back down both as a matter of principle and because Naruto continues to cheer for her. Hinata is saved from Neji. Neji directly attacks Hinata's heart, leading all but Naruto to believe she's been defeated. WhenHayate Gekk\\u014dis about to declare Neji the winner, Naruto stops him and motions to Hinata struggling to her feet. Neji tells her that her attempts to fight her destiny are only bringing her harm, but she rebuts that his own attempt to fight the destiny of the branch house brings him even more harm. Neji is enraged and attempts to kill her, but he is stopped by the observingj\\u014dnin. Hinata collapses, the damage to her organs being too severe, and before she loses consciousness she sees Naruto checking on her; she wonders if she managed to change at all. She's taken away by a team ofmedical-ninto be given emergency medical attention. After a month, on the day of the Ch\\u016bnin Exams' final matches, Hinata has recovered somewhat. Although she's supposed to take it easy, she practices at theThird Training Ground. Naruto stops there on his way to finals and is glad to see she's better. Because he's scheduled to fight Neji, Naruto shares his concerns that he might not be strong enough to defeat him. Hinata says that she believes he is strong enough, and that even if he isn't physically strong he still has strength of perseverance: a willingness to keep trying despite apparent failure until he finally conquers his obstacle. She admires him for that. Naruto is put at ease, thanks her, and informs her that his impression of her as \\\"weird\\\" was wrong, as he actually likes her. Hinata is left speechless as he walks away. Hinata watches Naruto's fight against Neji with Kiba. Seeing Naruto receive so many of Neji's attacks upsets Hinata and causes her internal injuries to begin bleeding again. Kiba gets anAnbu(Kabuto Yakushi) to treat her. Although the Anbu heals her, she is rendered unconscious and thus is unable to watch Naruto's defeat of Neji.

Naruto sees her, though he doesn't realise it's Hinata; she becomes embarrassed when he later tells Kiba about the \\\"beautiful girl\\\" he saw.

When Hinata was summoned to a meeting with theFifth Hokage, she was hopeful that she would also get sent on such a mission.

He then dies from his injuries. Naruto shares Kurama's chakra with Hinata. Naruto is disheartened by the deaths of Neji and others in the Alliance. When he starts to show signs of giving up, Hinata brings him back senses by reminding him of his vow to not let any of his friends die. Although Neji may be dead, he will live on so long as others continue the fight that he gave his life for. Therefore, Naruto must stay true to the creed he has been using for so long and that she has long since adopted for herself: to not give up. Naruto's resolve is renewed and he thanks her for standing by his side. He then takes her hand and transfers some chakra to her, giving her aversion 1-like shroud that protects her and augments her attacks against the Ten-Tails.

Because of the abilities this grants Obito, Hinata and most of the rest of the Alliance stand no chance against him and must leave the fighting to others such as Naruto and Sasuke. But Hinata remains alert for opportunities to contribute and pitches in when they emerge, first by joining the rest of the Konoha 11 in hitting Obito with one of Naruto'sRasengan, and then by assisting the rest of the Alliance with pulling the tailed beasts' chakra from Obito's body.

Although she completes the scarf, Hinata struggles to bring herself to give it to him, and it is only at the encouragement of Sakura and Hanabi that Hinata finally approaches Naruto. Once she finds him atRamen Ichiraku, Hinata is intimidated, first by Naruto's many otherfemale admirers, and then by the fact that he is already wearing a scarf that he clearly cherishes. Assuming she lost her chance to be with him, Hinata runs off. As she cries over the scarf alone, she is approached byToneri \\u014ctsutsuki, who requests to be given the scarf instead. He captures her with hispuppetsand they try escaping Konoha with her, but Naruto defeats the puppets and rescues her; the scarf she made is ripped in the battle. Hinata links with Naruto. In place of Hinata, Toneri is successfully able to kidnap Hanabi. Hinata requests to be added to theteamsent to rescue her. After leaving Konoha, Hinata is able to find Hanabi's trail using her Byakugan, which leads them to an underground passage. Shortly after entering the passageway, the team is trapped in agenjutsuthat dredges up old memories. While Hinata relives moments from her past that relate to Naruto, the scarf - which she's in the process of repairing - gets loose from her bag and wraps around Naruto, sharing her memories and corresponding feelings with him. Sakura is able to release them from the genjutsu and they start to continue ahead. Hinata is held back by Toneri, who expresses his desire to marry her. He explains that he has taken Hanabi's Byakugan for himself in order to carry outHamura \\u014ctsutsuki's decree to destroy the Earth, after which he can create a new world with Hinata's help. Hinata refuses to cooperate and vows to save Hanabi on her own, to which Toneri observes that she doesn't know where Hanabi is. Naruto interrupts them and defeats Toneri, who turns out to only be another puppet. Toneri tells Hinata that he'll return later for her answer. Naruto and Hinata reunite with the rest of the team and exit the underground passage, arriving in what they later discover is theMoon's interior. They split up to explore the surrounding landscape, with Naruto spending more time with Hinata. He now displays a greater interest in her thoughts and well-being, pleasing Hinata and giving her greater resolve to complete the scarf. As she is about to confide in him what Toneri told her, the rest of the team locates them and asks Hinata to look at a crypt they've found. There, Hinata is confronted by another member of the\\u014ctsutsuki clan, who shows her visions of how to stop Toneri and who introduces her to Hamura himself, who asks her to save the Earth. Naruto tells Hinata he loves her. Hinata does not share her visions with the others and starts diligently trying to complete the scarf. When they make camp later that night, Naruto confronts Hinata and assures her they will save Hanabi. He also tells her that he loves her, leaving her speechless. Rather, when Toneri comes for Hinata's answer, she gives the finished scarf to Naruto with her goodbyes and leaves with Toneri. When Naruto asks Hinata if it's a lie that she will marry Toneri, she reluctantly does not deny it. Upon seeing Naruto being hit by Toneri's attack, Toneri immediately put her to sleep. After she wakes up in Toneri's castle, Hinata checks on Hanabi to make sure she's alright and locates theTenseiganthat Toneri is using to control the Moon's movements against the Earth. She spends her time making yet another scarf, and when she has a chance she slips away to try to destroy the Tenseigan. She is found by Toneri's puppets and Toneri himself detains her. Hinata tries to reason with Toneri that Hamura never wished to destroy earth, but he doesn't listen. After which Toneri destroys the new scarf, that is actually meant for Naruto, and places her under his control. After being placed inside a picture frame, Hinata shed a tear over her regret about \\\"betraying\\\" Naruto. Hinata is forced to go through with a wedding ceremony, but as Toneri is about to kiss Hinata, Naruto interrupts the wedding. After Toneri leaves with her, Naruto is able to release her from Toneri's control, at which point she apologises to him for her earlier behaviour, though he states he already understands and forgives her. Toneri becomes distracted by his own awakeningTenseigan, allowing Hinata to escape with Naruto to the primary Tenseigan's location. Because she possesses Hamura's chakra, only Hinata is able to destroy it. However, she lacks the raw strength to do so, and must instead channel her chakra into Naruto so that they can destroy ittogether. With the Tenseigan gone, the Moon's movements stop and the puppets that the rest of the team is elsewhere fighting are rendered inert. The team reunites with them, bringing along a rescued Hanabi and the remains of Hinata's scarf. Even though it's in tatters, Naruto asks if he can have it anyway, which Hinata happily complies with. Naruto and Hinata share their first kiss. Toneri uses his own awakened Tenseigan to resume the Moon's movement towards the Earth. He then attacks them and captures Hinata, forcing her to watch as he tries to kill Naruto. Naruto ends up defeating him instead and Hinata, once freed, takes back Hanabi's eyes. Toneri tries to make one final attack and Naruto and Hinata prepare to face him together, but Toneri is knocked into space by thestatue. Naruto saves him and Toneri gives up, allowing Hinata to tell him Hamura's true wishes: to protect the Earth, not to destroy it. Toneri is repentant and remains behind when they head home, vowing not to let the Moon endanger the Earth again. As they return through the same passage they used before, Hinata asks Naruto about the scarf he's been wearing. He tells her it was a gift from hismother, causing her embarrassment that she would be jealous. Upon hearing Naruto say that he wants to spend the rest of his life with her, Hinata sheds tears of joy. As the passageway disintegrates behind them, Naruto propels himself and Hinata back to the Earth, where they share their first kiss.

After Boruto left, Hinata talked more with Shino, apologising for the trouble Boruto was causing, noting that he wanted her husband's attention to the point where, like his father, Boruto wants to make a name for himself. Shino then convinced Hinata to talk to Naruto about Boruto's actions. When Naruto came home late briefly for a change of clothing, the two spoke. Naruto expressed regret at not being a more attentive father, feeling that his lack of actual parenting growing up made him subpar as one himself, Hinata insisted that for all of Boruto's actions, deep down he understands Naruto's responsibilities as Hokage.

The stadium is then immediately attacked byKinshikiandMomoshiki \\u014ctsutsuki, and Hinata evacuates with the other spectators.

Main article:One-Tail Escort ArcIn the anime, as Hinata was preparing a family camping trip, Boruto explained that he was going on a training mission with Team 7 (unaware that Boruto was really going to find Sasuke to train with him).

Later, when a more proper safehouse for Shukaku was prepared, Naruto proceeded to have the tailed beast moved to it. Main article:Time Slip ArcLater, Hinata watched as an eager Boruto quickly finished his breakfast in hopes to train more with Sasuke. Hinata noted that Boruto was just like Naruto at that age, always eager to train with his mentor Jiraiya. Hinata then showed Himawari and Boruto a photo of the Sannin, who Himawari noted looked eccentric and wild. Hinata told her kids about Jiraiya's greatness as a ninja and how influential he was to Naruto, even becoming a father-figure. Later that night, Hinata found Boruto looking through Naruto's belongings for theIcha Ichaseries, hoping to learn more about Jiraiya and the \\\"wisdom\\\" it gave. After glancing at a few pages and seeing its adult content, Hinata sternly forbade Boruto from reading the books, insisting that he was too young. A young Hinata meets Boruto. Meanwhile, the grown-up Sasuke and Boruto were later sent back in time to shortly after Sasuke's defection. There, the two pretended to be travelling performers and were put under watch by Naruto. Past-Hinata met her future son, who despite her normal shy nature, felt calm and open to Boruto. Later, she and her friends helped Boruto and Naruto clean up a bathhouse after the commotion Naruto and Jiraiya caused. Days later, after Sasuke and Boruto managed to kill Urashiki and end his terror, they decided to return to their time promptly to preserve the timeline. To ensure that, Sasuke first used his Sharingan toerasethe memories of everyone he and Boruto came in contact of the recent events. Back in the present, Hiashi's birthday was fast approaching, and it was suggested by Hanabi to throw a party for him. Hinata helped Himawari pick out a scarf for him as a present. At the party, Hinata joined her family in a group photo as suggested by Boruto. Main article:Kara Actuation ArcIn the anime, Hinata was heartbroken when she heard her son was viciously defeated in battle byDeepa. As Boruto was operated on, she and Himawari watched in concern. Naruto soon arrived, equally concerned about his son. Upon seeing that he was stabilised, Naruto assured his family that Boruto was going to fine, much to Hinata's relief. After Boruto was released from the hospital and began training under Kakashi Hatake to grow stronger, while her daughter was still concerned for Boruto, Hinata insisted that Boruto was a true ninja and desired to be of true aid to others. Instead, Hinata suggested that Himawari helped cheer Boruto on by helping her mother make a bento and deliver it to him. In the following days, as Hinata continued to provide support for Boruto by bringing him lunches while training, she discovered that Sakura was growing concerned for Sarada's well-being in her own training, especially given the Uchiha's history with loss. Ino and Hinata decided to take Sakura out on a girl's night to talk. They insisted that as mothers themselves, they too fear for their children's well-being, but they have to have faith that they are strong and can endure. Their words managed to cheer up Sakura. Main article:Ao ArcIn the anime, Hinata attended the memorial service for the fallen people of the Fourth Shinobi World War, holding a portrait of Neji in his honour.

During which, despite Hinata treating him with kindness like any other, the rebellious boy kept seeing everyone as his enemy. He soon made his move to escape, only to be stopped by Naruto's brief show ofpower. When Boruto returned, he and the boy got into a confrontation over the latter's recent actions destroying Himawari\\u2018s personal vase, which she made as a gift to Hinata. As Himawari began cleaning up the broken pieces, the boy gruffly apologised for his unintentional mistake, introducing himself asKawaki. Later, as Kawaki attempted to find a missing fragment of the vase, Naruto doubted he would be able to find it, as Hinata cleans the house everyday. Hinata and Himawari left to shop for dinner just beforeJigenappeared in their home.

Main article:Kawaki & Himawari Academy ArcIn the anime, Hinata was glad to hear that Himawari was having a good time in the Academy. Later, she was surprised to learn that Himawari had not actually decided on becoming a shinobi, but rather saw the Academy as an opportunity to learn about herself and meet people. Hinata and Naruto were happy to see how maturely Himawari was taking her experiences. Main article:Code's Assault Arc Hinata and her family welcome Kawaki with a feast. After Jigen, leader ofKara, was able to infiltrate Konoha and critically injured Naruto and Sasuke in an attempt to reclaim Kawaki, Hinata and her family were relieved when Naruto made a quick recovery. Later, following Isshiki's permanent death, they decided to throw a welcome dinner party for Kawaki, to show he was truly welcomed in the Uzumaki home. While Kawaki asked to throw away a box of old magazines, Hinata watched a movie with Naruto with emotion. Later, Boruto rushed in to alert his parents that Kawaki had evaded surveillance and left the village. When learning that Boruto and Kawaki were in trouble, Hinata was determined to help her husband in the rescue, only to be reminded that she needed to look after Himawari should the worst happen. She reluctantly conceded, praying for all of them to return safely. Main article:Omnipotence ArcWhen Boruto was called in for his first mission in a long time, Hinata cried, worried that this time he might not come back, despite his assurance he would return. After he left, Himawari told her she could help Boruto if she became a shinobi, and asked if it would make her worry more instead. Hinata slaps Kawaki. While preparing for dinner with Naruto, she wished that Boruto and Kawaki could join them, asking Naruto how long their mission could take. Having left the house, Kawaki joined them, wishing to talk to Naruto. Kawaki told them how much Naruto meant to him, and how far he was willing to go to get rid of all \\u014ctsutsuki, Boruto included. Hinata was hurt by it and slapped Kawaki. He conceded he might be insane for what he was willing to do, and sent them away with a rift to stop them from interfering, willing to bear their hate and welcoming them to kill him when he was done. Naruto and Hinata were kept inDaikokuten, suspended in time, unable to think, age, and requiring no air or sustenance.

Main article:Road to Ninja: Naruto the MovieHinata and the rest of the Konoha 11 fight off an attack by what seems to be the entireAkatsukiroster, but what are actually disguised parts of theWhite Zetsu Army. When Naruto and Sakura are sent to theGenjutsu World, they meet that world's Hinata: she is dressed provocatively and is more assertive and confident in herself. She is aggressively infatuated with the Genjutsu World'sNaruto, to the point of threatening any girl who is with him; Sakura becomes frightened by Hinata's threat to kill her for \\\"flirting\\\" with Naruto. Hinata Hy\\u016bga is a playable character in the following video games: In later instalments of theClash of Ninjaseries, Hinata is playable in an \\\"awakened\\\" form. In this form, her clothes are similar to what she wore during theBik\\u014dch\\u016b Search Mission, though the form itself is not based on the events of that arc. Awakened Hinata has a personality similar to Neji's during the Ch\\u016bnin Exams, arrogantly challenging opponents and boasting about the power of the main branch of the Hy\\u016bga clan. While in this form, she is also able to use techniques such asEight Trigrams Sixty-Four PalmsandEight Trigrams Palms Revolving Heaven. MostClash of Ninjagames require that this awakened Hinata be selected separately, but inClash of Ninja Revolution 3, normal Hinata can transform into her in the middle of battle by activating her Byakugan. A similar form appears inUltimate Ninja 2, dubbed \\\"Byakugan Hinata\\\", with the main difference being she wears the traditional Hy\\u016bga attire. In several of theUltimate Ninja Stormgames, the team combination of Hinata and Naruto is titled \\\"Secret Lovers\\\" or \\\"Joined Hands\\\". Hinata is featured in the online game,Fortnite, in her Part II outfit as a playable skin.\",\n          \"After Hinata gained a brutal beating from sparring Neji, both Hinata's father andgrandfatherbegan doubting her potential, especially when her younger sisterHanabi's own prowess began rivalling Hinata's, despite being five years younger. Ultimately, it was decided Hinata and Hanabi would duel to decide the future heir of their clan. While the two sisters began fighting on par with each other, Hinata soon had an opening to win, but hesitated in not wanting to hurt her sister, to which Hanabi quickly counterattacked and won the duel. As a result, her frailty disheartened her father, which made Hinata lose her position to Hanabi. As her father chose to focus and develop Hanabi, he left Hinata underKurenai Y\\u016bhi's care and protection, deeming her a lost cause due to her lack of drive. Hinata's strained relationship with her father caused her to lose more faith in herself and she would often spend her time alone, crying. It was not until she met Naruto that her perception changed drastically: On a snowy day in March, while preparing to enroll at theAcademy, Hinata was degraded by a group of three bullies for her Byakugan. Naruto, who had witnessed the event, refused to let them insult her and came to her defense. Since they outnumbered him, the bullies had beaten him up and trampled over his red scarf. Surprised by how much Naruto stood up for someone he did not know, Hinata thanked him while Naruto let her keep the scarf since it was ruined. Ever since then, Hinata developed a strong admiration towards Naruto, and because he was treated as an outcast by almost everyone in the village, she found herself able to relate with his desire to be acknowledged and praised. She was also amazed that despite having nothing and no one to rely on, Naruto never gave up in believing he could become something great likeHokage. Inspired by his determination, Hinata ultimately decided to try her best to become strong so she could be acknowledged as well, and adopted Naruto'snind\\u014dof never giving up. Her admiration for Naruto eventually grew into love, despite warnings from her elders to stay away from him. Hinata is characterized as a shy, thoughtful, serene, kind and very polite girl, as noted from her always addressing people with properhonourifics. She is also very gentle, a trait that Neji and her father used to consider a flaw, and dislikes competing and fighting. She is shown to be incredibly empathetic, and, because of her upbringing, is one of the very first characters who identifies with Naruto's painful childhood and desire to be acknowledged and the very first person who actually supports him. Despite her fascination with Naruto, she wasn't allowed to approach him, due to being Hyuga Clan's heir, thus was strictly guarded and scheduled, and she lacked the nerve to defy her father; in the Academy, she finally had further freedom, but couldn't directly approach Naruto at first due to her strong shyness. Back in her childhood, as a result of her clan's high expectations as their heiress and her father, Hiashi's grueling training, being overshadowed by her younger sister, Hanabi, and Hiashi deeming her as a failure, Hinata had become very timid and lacked self-confidence. However, she has shown to be a very hard worker (something that her father initially failed to notice), as she continuously strove to change herself for the better, though initially this lack of self-confidence would hinder her on even missions. As the series progressed, Hinata became more open about her opinion and confident overall, as she demonstrated a willingness on occasion to take decisive action than ever before. By the time of theFourth Shinobi World War, her bravery and confidence has extended to the part where she is willing to put her own life on the line for her village, friends, and family. The strongest amount of Hinata's newfound confidence and bravery was displayed after Neji had died where, although shedding tears for her cousin's death, she was able to pull herself together, and even preventObito Uchihafrom breaking Naruto's spirit. Hinata's growing self-confidence mainly comes from her long-standing admiration for Naruto, as she was inspired by his enthusiasm and his unyielding determination to never give up no matter what the odds. In the beginning, Hinata was very shy around Naruto, constantly blushing and stuttering when talking with him. However, as Hinata's confidence in herself grows she gradually becomes more confident with herself and her desire to gain Naruto's affections. As the series progressed, her admiration towards him grew into genuine care and affection, eventually leading her to fall in love with him. Hinata also has an unshakeable faith in Naruto, believing that he will one day achieve his goal of becoming Hokage. DuringPain's assaulton Konoha, Hinata finally confessed her love to Naruto and was also willing to risk her life to protect him; Hinata realised that she was much weaker than Pain - who was uncharacteristically surprised by her efforts - yet she still was courageous enough to defend Naruto and enable his freedom from the chakra rods. After Neji was killed by Obito, she pulled herself together despite the pain she was feeling so she could inspire Naruto once more to not give up on himself, reiterating their sharednind\\u014d, showing how far she has come. Her feelings for Naruto have ultimately become her greatest desire, simply to be together with Naruto, as shown through theInfinite Tsukuyomi. This desire would finally become a reality years after the war, when Hinata and Naruto got married and started a family of their own, with two children that she like her husband, loves dearly. Ironically, when Naruto began to realize his love for her, she was oblivious to it like he was to her that it took him accidentally confessing to her to realize it. By the end of Part I, Hinata was able to foster better relations with both Neji and her father and started training with them, as well as growing closer and stronger together as a family. She is especially caring towards her little sister, Hanabi, to the point where she was hesitant to hurt her, even during their match to determine the heir to their clan. Two years after the Fourth Shinobi World War, when Hanabi was captured byToneri \\u014ctsutsuki, she went to great lengths to save her such as \\\"agreeing\\\" to marry Toneri, but in truth, it was a ruse; in spite of Hinata's hatred of having to deceive Naruto, she was able to be pragmatic for the sake of her sister and world itself, which demanded her to avoid raising Toneri's suspicions. After Toneri was seemingly foiled, Hinata emphatically apologised to Naruto for the deception, while he likewise apologised for failing to understand her tactics at first; though neither Hinata nor Naruto felt anger or merely annoyance over each other, due to both being incredibly forgiving inherently, and both grateful for their love too much to be concerned. Hinata is also the closest to her sensei Kurenai, who is not only interested in Hinata's growth as a ninja but also as a person. She knows Hinata's personal struggles and unlike her demanding father, Kurenai tries her best to coach Hinata in ways in which she knows her pupil will best respond. After Hinata was knocked down for the final time by Neji in theCh\\u016bnin Exams, Kurenai silently congratulated her student's resolve and perseverance. Kurenai is aware of her affection for Naruto and encourages her to express herself to him; Kurenai would also act as her pupil's support in person when Hinata was struggling to other healing ointment to Naruto. Hinata gets along well with her teammates. Kiba has become one of her closest friends, and his actions toward her are often motivated by his concern for her, such as when he urged her to forfeit if she was matched against Neji or Gaara during the Ch\\u016bnin Exams. Kiba is also aware of her feelings for Naruto, as he tends to tease her a lot about them by embarrassing her by telling her Naruto is near when he is not or pointing out when she blushes when thinking about Naruto. Shino possesses a quiet confidence in Hinata, and will make a point of assuring others when they doubt or worry about her; both Kiba and Shino hold a brotherly attachment to Hinata, thus they are both protective and encouraging of her. Perhaps due to her shyness and insecurity from being considered a failure, Hinata also had self-esteem issues in her appearance. By the time she was 16, she had become noticeably beautiful, however, her attire was either formal Hyuga ware, or most commonly her ninja uniform that was so baggy it hid her features. Granted, a not mutually exclusive factor could be that she was aware of her growth, but felt so self-conscious that she took steps to hide that fact; in the bathhouse, she became really self-conscious when other girls complimented her development. By the time she was 18, her experiences had built up her confidence so that her ninja outfit was more form-fitting and revealed her arms, in contrast to her original overly long sleeves. Ironically, her loss of insecurity coincided with Naruto's realisation that he loved her, thus he bashfully pointed out the relatively revealing style of her outfit, which she no longer considered an issue. While originally becoming overwhelmed by bashfulness and nerves to even be in the presence of Naruto, eventually, as her confidence grew over time, she was able to interact with him without stammering or passing out anymore; although, should there be somewhat lengthy separations, her prior shyness would return to an extent. Hinata was able to fearlessly confess her love during her fight against Pain, however, the life-threatening status of the situation, and presumption of death, likely gave her the push - if not adrenaline boost - to ignore her usual shy nature. Although, years later even at 18 years old, if she actually tried to express her feelings for him again, but during an everyday scenario, she would blush and be easily deterred; despite her hesitation being connected to her self-esteem, it was also simply her love being unconditional, since she only wanted Naruto to be happy, and although personally sad, she would selflessly support his happiness overall, even it were with another girl. After becoming a mother, Hinata became more mature and seemingly gained a stricter side, having to remind her children not to run outside barefoot when embracing their father. Furthermore, her heightened strictness has allowed her to keep both Naruto and Boruto in line, with the latter being fearful of incurring Hinata's anger. However, she is not above joining in their fun, such as having a snowball fight with them and her husband, and acts as a wise and supportive figure for her family. She does have some remnants of her old bashful self, such as when reminiscing about her past with Naruto, she falls into daydreaming until someone interjects, which makes her slightly embarrassment. Hinata's variant in the genjutsu world inRoad to Ninja: Naruto the Movie, like most has a vastly opposite personality. She is abrasive, ill-tempered, mean-spirited, violent, arrogant, and aggressively possessive of Menma (Naruto's alternate self). Unlike the regular world, she is the most dominant of the Hyuga, causing the bumbling Neji to become terrified of her anger. She also flaunts her beauty now, with her routine outfit, but now with shorts and the coat is unzipped to reveal a mesh midriff top. The only main personality continuation is her love for Menma/Naruto, although her possessiveness drives her to dangerous jealousy. Hinata has dark blue hair and fair skin - traits that she inherited from hermother. She also has the customary white eyes of her clan, which have a tinge of lavender in the anime. She is usually seen with a timid, shy expression in Part I, but less so in Part II, with the exception of when she is around Naruto. Like the rest of her clan, she possesses the renownedByakuganwhich, when activated, stimulates the veins and arteries immediately around her eyes to protrude much more prominently. In Part I, her hair was in a short, leveled hime-cut style just above her forehead, with chin-length strands framing her face. She wore a cream-coloured hooded-jacket with a fire symbol on the upper right and left sleeves and fur around the cuffs and hem, with navy blue pants. After earning her genin rank, she wore her Konohaforehead protectoraround her neck. At the Ch\\u016bnin Exams finals, Hinata wore a long-sleeved, light blue blouse with a high collar, and dark blue pants. While at home, she was seen in the traditional Hy\\u016bga garb, consisting of a simple, loose-fitting robe with different colored trimmings, and an under-shirt. In Part II, Hinata retained her straight, hime-style haircut, but she had let her hair grow to reach her lower back, while the short strands that frame her face had grown to shoulder-length. Her figure had also grown to become much womanlier. She also donned an attire comprised of a loose-fitting, lavender and cream hooded jacket with lavender cuffs over mesh armor with navy blue pants and black, low-heeled sandals. Although she still wore her forehead protector around her neck, its color had changed from blue to black. In one of theomakes, she was seen wearing a beige apron and light blue scarf tied in a bandana style. In another omake, she was seen in a casual outfit that consisted of brown capri pants, brown sandals, and a dark green, hood-less jacket with a fire symbol on the upper-right side of her chest. The cuffs of the jacket were rolled up to the middle of her forearms; the inside of the jacket was shown to be cream-colored. Hinata had a light lavender blouse underneath. During the Fourth Shinobi World War, she donned the standard uniform of her village inclusive offlak jacket. Instead of wearing the forehead protector of theAllied Shinobi Forces, she has seemingly opted not to wear one at all. Two years afterthe Fourth Shinobi World War at age 18, Hinata changed her previous outfit to a slightly more revealing and form-fitting one. She is now seen wearing a light lavender, sleeveless kimono-style blouse with vertical lines, tied with a dark purple obi around her waist. She wears a pair of short dark navy shorts with thigh-high stockings, revealing parts of her upper thighs, and has changed her regular ninja sandals to black high-heeled boots. Hinata's hair increase slightly in volume and grows to hip-length. She also no longer wears her forehead protector. While off-duty, she wears a grey long-sleeved shirt underneath a pink shirt, black pants underneath a long cream-coloured skirt with pink horizontal stripes, and a pair of brown sandals. She is also seen wearing a lavender hooded jacket. After Hinata was brainwashed by Toneri during their marriage ceremony, she wore a black long and sleeveless dress with a high collar and matching long gloves. She also wore a blackturbanwith a black and light-yellow veil over, and yellow crescent moon earrings. After she marries Naruto and becomes a mother, Hinata has cut her hair and bangs to shoulder-length. Her attire consists of a maroon jacket with a dark purple shirt and a cream-coloured skirt. She also wears a pair of lavender slippers. Years later, Hinata has let her hair grow long again, and ties it in a ponytail now. She also dons an outfit that consists of a long-sleeved, collared white shirt, lavender dress, and blue pants. Hinata was born on December 27 and is the first daughter of Hiashi, who is the leader of the clan, and his unnamed wife. She has a younger sister named Hanabi and a cousin namedNeji. Hinata is described as a weakling in the clan because of her sweet and gentle nature in which her father fears that she is not fit to be the next heir to the clan and that her sister who is only about five years younger can surpass her. Hinata does her very best to become strong and she trains very hard to impress her father. Hinata has both feelings and admiration for Naruto who gives her the confidence to work very hard. She was later taken in byKurenai Y\\u016bhiwho became her sensei, and she later became part of the Rookie 9. During the Chunin Exams, she fought against her cousin Neji with Naruto cheering her on and giving her the courage to never back down, even though she was severely wounded. She is now on good terms with her clan, especially with Neji, who has become her protector, and later watched Naruto depart with Jiraiya on his two-year training so that he can get Sasuke back after he, the retrieval team, Rock Lee, and the three sand siblings previously failed due to the interference of Kimimaro. Hinata Hyuga (Shippuden) In Part II, Hinata is 16 years old and is now a full-level Chunin. When Naruto came back home for the first time after his journey, Hinata blushed and fainted. Hinata was assigned with her team along with Team Kakashi to look for Sasuke. Hinata along with Naruto and Yamato split up together until they were confronted by Kabuto Yakushi who gave them a book that had records and all the information about the Akatsuki members. Before Kabuto left, Hinata used her Byakugan and noticed that 33 percent of Kabuto's body is being covered with Orochimaru's flesh. Later, Hinata met up with her team and they encountered Tobi who delayed their search. Hinata used her Byakugan to help guide her team in finding Tobi. After hearing the news thatSasukedefeatedItachi, Tobi disappeared and Hinata used her Byakugan to help her team follow him. Hinata discovered that there were black flames (Amaterasu) burning where Sasuke and Itachi had their final battle, and the team rushed to investigate only to find that Tobi got there before they did and took Sasuke with him. Later, Pain invaded Konoha and Hinata helped tend to the citizens to escape the wreckage and heal the wounded. Hinata witnessed Naruto fighting Pain with her Byakugan and noticed that Naruto was starting to lose to Pain and was pinned down by him. Despite Naruto's orders not to get involved in his battle, Hinata rushed to Naruto's aid to defend Naruto. Naruto asked her why she was throwing her life away and she told him that she was doing it because she loved him, which shocked Naruto. In the manga, Hinata used herTwin Lion Fiststo attack Pain, but Pain simply dodged the attack, threw her down, and used his Chakra Sensor Rod and stab her. In the anime, she was able to hit the Deva Path with herTwin Lion Fistsand Pain used hisShinra Tenseito subdue her, but Hinata was able to stand up and continue to fight. She was able to crawl over to Naruto and remove the Chakra sensor Rod from Naruto's hand. While her nindo way was echoing in Naruto's head, Naruto watched as Pain stabbed Hinata. In both of these versions, it caused Naruto to snap and release the Eight-TailedKuramawhile the weakened Hinata watched on. Hinata was taken away from the team with Sakura healing her. Later, a relieved Hinata celebrated with the villagers on Naruto's victory of defeating Nagato and she smiled softly as the worried Sakura hugged and thanked Naruto. to be added to be added Originally, Hinata was considered weak due to her gentle personality which hindered her performance which deemed her unworthy for her role as the clan heiress. After committing herself to training to become stronger for Naruto, she received praise from her team and her clan for improving her skills and strengthening character. Two years after the war, Hinata was recognized byHamura \\u014ctsutsukias the Byakugan Princess proved to be crucial in the destruction of the Tenseigan, although she could not destroy it herself. Despite spending at least, a decade as a housewife she was able to survive an attempt to get Naruto back fromMomoshiki \\u014ctsutsukiand defeat Hanabi who is an active j\\u014dnin and continues training to become the next clan leader, in a sparring match. Hinata at the time was reluctant to fight and unprepared when Hanabi was attacking seriously. Despite being rusty, she was able to keep up and win against Hanabi. From special clan training, Hinata has very advanced chakra control. Hinata did additional training and expanded on it during Part I; one product of this training was to make Water Needles by forming her chakra around her from nearby water sources and be used as a projectile. By Part II of the anime, Hinata's control has advanced enough to match a medical-nin. which was the reason she was assigned to help perform the Four-Corner Sealing Barrier. When meeting Hamura, she inherited some of his charka because she is a member of the main house of the Hy\\u016bga clan. Its strength and purity of her chakra attractsToneri \\u014ctsutsuki. Because she is a member of the main house of the Hy\\u016bga clan and a direct bloodline from Hamura she could come into contact and find the Tenseigan. Though she could not destroy it herself, she instead held Naruto's hand to give him allowance to touch the Tenseigan and for him to destroy it, since anyone who does not have the bloodline of a Hy\\u016bga and \\u014ctsutsuki cannot touch it. As a Hy\\u016bga, Hinata possesses the Byakugan, which grants her penetrative vision in a near-360\\u00b0 around herself, with a blind spot at the back of the neck above the first thoracic vertebra. With it, she is able to assist others frequently in tracking, and scouting the area for their target(s); by focusing her vision on a single direction, Hinata can see across distances, reaching as far as 20 kilometers by the battle against Toneri. Hinata's Byakugan grants her attacks with pinpoint accuracies, which she can share with others to also improve their own. She can also use it in order to identify genjutsu, searching for the caster in the nearby area. In the anime, she can use infrared vision and magnify it to see tiny targets. By adulthood, the chakra sensitivity provided by the Byakugan allows her to pick up on the slightest presence of chakra.

Her designs are great and very cute. While she isn't really a fighter, she still puts up a good fight whenever she does battle. LikeTsunade, Konan, Chiyo, etc., she is one of the few well-written female characters in the series. Even though she is rather kindhearted and tender, she does have some really scary moments, most notably in the Boruto series. By Part II of the anime, Hinata's control of her chakra has advanced enough to match a medical-nin's, for which reason she is assigned to help perform the Four-Corner Sealing Barrier. During the Chunin Exams, she allowed Naruto to cheat on her test, however he declined. During Naruto's fight with Kiba, Hinata's loyalties are torn; she wants to cheer for Naruto, but fears that would be rude to Kiba. After said fight, she gave some healing ointment to both Naruto and Kiba so their wounds can heal faster. While she was badly injured and almost killed after her fight with Neji, she still put up a great fight against him, and it showed us that she isn't the useless type of girl. She, along with Sakura, Ino, Kiba, Izumo and a few others were some of the few people to cheer for Naruto during his fight against Neji. During a filler arc, she went off by herself and trained by a waterfall in order to create a new jutsu, which later turned out to be the 8 Trigrams 64 Palms. Before Naruto returned to the village from training, during a second Chunin Exams, she became a Chunin along with her team. In thePain's Assaultarc, when Naruto was impaled and pinned down by Pain's chakra rods, rendering him immobile, she attempted to protect him while fighting Pain, knowing that she doesn't stand a chance and might die fighting Pain, but just wanted to protect Naruto when no one else did and puts her life on the line. The scene where she confesses her feelings to Naruto is one of the most emotional/heartwarming moments in the series due to how much she loves Naruto and is willing to sacrifice herself to protect him. Although she gets overpowered and defeated by Pain, this act from Hinata would pave the way of Naruto's victory over Pain. During the Fourth Great Shinobi War, after Neji collapsed from exhaustion, she took responsibility for monitoring the Second Division's perimeter with her Byakugan When Neji sacrificed his life to protect Naruto and Hinata from the Ten-Tailed Beast, Obito taunts Naruto with his speech that if he keeps resisting, all of his friends will share the same fate as Neji, making Naruto nearly lost all hope and join Obito to stop further bloodshed, but Hinata prevented Naruto from joining Obito and encourages him to not give up and to not let Neji's death be in vain, which motivates Naruto to continue fighting and share his chakra with everyone. With her Byakugan, she saw the Ten-Tails being absorbed into Obito, meaning he has become its jinchuriki, and informed Sakura and the Alliance about it. During the Last, she decided to confess her feelings for Naruto by knitting a scarf for him, a replacement for the damaged one he gave her when they were children. Later in the movie, she gave the finished scarf to Naruto with her goodbyes and leaves with Toneri. While this seemed like she was marrying him, it turned out to be a plan to get closer to Hanabi, who has been kidnapped by him. Later on, she tried to reason with Toneri that Hamura never wished to destroy earth, but he doesn't listen. Then, Hinata attempts to destroy the Tenseigan Altar as per Hamura\\u2019s request only to be stopped by Toneri, after which he destroys the new scarf, that is actually meant for Naruto, and places her under his control. After being placed inside a picture frame, she shed a tear over her regret about \\\"betraying\\\" Naruto. When Naruto released her from Toneri's control, at which point she apologized to him for her earlier behavior, though he states he already understands and forgives her. In Boruto, she became a great mother, heck, she almost sacrificed herself to save Naruto when he was kidnapped by Momoshiki.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Personality\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Hinata's outlook sees a shift after her appointment to Team 8. Whereas her father and much of the Hy\\u016bga clan had decided she was a lost cause who would never amount to anything,[15]her team considers her a valuable member with her special strong points. Originally, she would over-rely on her teammates, looking to them in times of difficulty to save her from situations that make her uncomfortable. It is for her teammates - among other reasons - that Hinata starts seeking to change herself, as she wishes to help the team rather than burden it.[16] Hinata dreams of being with Naruto. Hinata's primary motivation is Naruto Uzumaki, with whom she has been fascinated since meeting him. He initially gained her attention because of his kindness to her and outspoken nature, and then kept her attention because of similarities that Hinata perceived to herself: Naruto had a painful childhood without the love of parents, a fate worse than the mere difficulty she had with her own father, and he craves the attention and acknowledgement of anybody, just as Hinata wants to please her father.[17]But whereas Hinata lost faith in herself, Naruto always believed he can accomplish any given task if he tries hard enough. She admires him deeply for this courage and over time fell deeply in love with him, which manifests as increased shyness and speechlessness when around him, something that became apparent to everyone, apart from ironically Naruto himself. Hinata strives to prove herself to others, but mostly to gain the attention and worthiness of Naruto. She emulates him to this purpose, adopting hisnind\\u014dof never giving up to improve herself. To that end, she stops running from confrontation, instead doing all that she can to face it, even in the face of failure to keep trying, and willing to risk her life for her loved ones and village.[18]By the end of Part I, her clan's faith in her is restored and strengthened.[19] Hinata's intimidating demeanour. Throughout the years, Naruto remains her primary motivation; she willingly faced Pain to protect Naruto, despite knowing she has no chance of winning.[20]She even defends Naruto from himself when he's in doubt, repeating to him his refusal to never give up.[21]Two yearsafter the war, upon achieving hergreatest dreamof having her love reciprocated by Naruto to form a deep and committed relationship together, she became more expressive about her feelings. In the anime, she is able to laugh openly because of it.[22]After marrying Naruto and he becomes Hokage, Hinata remains supportive of him and his increased responsibilities, even though she yearns for him to be home more often. As a mother and wife, she has become a master homemaker, keeping the family well-structured yet well-adjusted and happy. While very loving and supportive of her family, she is equally strict and assertive. Her newfound structured nature made her very intimidating and more easily angered when her family acts up, easily keeping them in line and swiftly punishing them for their misconduct.[23][8]She is also insightful and wise with her words, realising that her children, particularly Boruto, take after Naruto in the desire to prove themselves to others and that she must believe in them to do things on their own.[24] Hinata is a slender girl of fair-complexion who, as a Hy\\u016bga, her most distinguishing trait is theByakugan, giving her featureless white eyes (lavender in the anime). She has dark blue hair that she keeps in a bob-cut of different lengths: in Part I, her hair is cut just above her forehead akin to a bowl-cut with chin-length strands framing her face; in Part II, her hair reaches her lower back and the framing strands reach shoulder-length; inThe Last: Naruto the Movie, her hair extends beyond her hips and she would at times tie it into a ponytail. By the time Boruto entered the Academy, she cut it into a bob-style reaching her shoulders.[25]She is noted to be beautiful by Naruto[12]andToneri \\u014ctsutsuki. In Part I, Hinata usually wears a cream-coloured hooded-jacket with a fire symbol on the upper sleeves and fur around the cuffs and hem. She also wears navy blue pants and keeps herforehead protectorloosely around her neck. In Part II, she dons a lavender and cream hooded-jacket with lavender cuffs over mesh armour. She also wears navy blue pants, black, low-heeled sandals, and changes the cloth of her forehead protector from blue to black. Hinata switches to the standard Konoha infantryflak jacketand assorted clothing during the Fourth Shinobi World War, though she does not appear to wear a forehead protector. Two years after the war, Hinata's mission attire is a form-fitting light lavender, sleeveless kimono-style blouse with vertical lines, tied with a dark purple obi around her waist and short dark navy shorts. She also wore thigh-high stockings with black, open-toed boots. She does not wear her forehead protector at all. Her outfits become more varied after that, changing to match the occasion or simply being more casual than her prior garb. During Hinata's and Toneri's wedding, she wore a wide black and grey top with a long grey sash around her waist. She also wore short puffy pants with black lace socks and sandals. On her head was a black turban with a black and light yellow veil over and yellow crescent moon earrings. During Hinata's and Naruto's wedding, she wore a traditional white kimono with a flower in her hair. After getting married, she consistently wears a light purple short-sleeved jacket, a long-sleeved white shirt with a two pink coloured strips underneath it, light brown shorts and purple open-toed boots. In theBorutomanga, Hinata has a necklace with the Uzumaki symbol on it. She also wears her wedding ring on her left hand and has her hair cut into a short bob style with fringes covering the top of her forehead. Hinata repelling a Ten-Tails mini-clone with the Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms. Originally, Hinata's gentle personality hindered her performance, to which she was deemed too weak and unworthy for the role of heir.[26]After committing herself getting stronger in her training for Naruto, receiving consistent praise from her team and clan for her improving skills and strengthening character.[27][20][18]Two years after the war, Hinata, having been recognised byHamura \\u014ctsutsukias the Byakugan Princess, proves to be crucial in the destruction of theTenseigan, even though she herself can't destroy it.[7] Over a decade later, while rusty as she retired to be a housewife, Hinata's prowess still remained formidable. Despite being unprepared and reluctant to fight Hanabi, an active j\\u014dnin who continues training to become the next Hy\\u016bga clan leader, Hinata decisively defeated her sister in a match.[28] Hinata's Gentle Step: Twin Lion Fist using Hamura's chakra. From her special clan training, Hinata has advanced control of her chakra. In the anime, Hinata's additional training during Part I resulted in her ability to free herself from contraints[29]and manipulate nearby water sources, turning them intoprojectiles.[30]By Part II of the anime, Hinata's control has advanced enough to match amedical-nin's, for which reason she is assigned to help perform theFour-Corner Sealing Barrier. When she met Hamura, Hinata inherited some of hischakrabecause she is a member of the Hy\\u016bga clan's main house. It is the strength and purity of her chakra that attractsToneri \\u014ctsutsuki. It is also because of her being the member of the Hy\\u016bga clan's main house and direct bloodline from Hamura that she can touch and find the Tenseigan, though she can't destroy it by herself, so instead she held Naruto's hand to give him allowance to touch the Tenseigan and for him to destroy it, since anyone without the Hy\\u016bga and\\u014ctsutsukibloodline can't touch it. Hinata's Byakugan. As a Hy\\u016bga, Hinata possesses the Byakugan, ad\\u014djutsuthat grants her penetrative vision in a near-360\\u00b0 around herself, with one blind spot at the back of the neck above the firstthoracic vertebra.[31]With it, she is able to assist others frequently in tracking, scouting the area for their target(s); by focusing her vision in a single direction, Hinata can see across vast distances, able to see at least 1 kilometre during her first Ch\\u016bnin Exam, and reaching as far away as 20 kilometres by the battle against Toneri. Hinata's Byakugan grants her attacks pinpoint accuracy, which she can share with others to also improve their own.[32]She can also use it in order to identifygenjutsu, searching for the caster in the nearby area.[33]In the anime, Hinata can useinfraredvision and magnify in to see tiny targets.[34]By adulthood, the chakra sensitivity provided by the Byakugan allows her to pick up on the slightest presence of chakra.[35] As is traditional in her clan, Hinata has been extensively trained in theGentle Fistfighting style. In unison with her Byakugan, Hinata can attack accurately target an individuals'chakra pathway systemsand the 361tenketsuthat run along it, constricting or cutting off their chakra flow from only minimal contact.[15]Although this enables Hinata to attack an opponent's internal organs, she can also use it in a supplementary function, such as by setting dislocated shoulders back in place.[36] Hinata and Neji combining their Eight Trigrams Vacuum Palms. While Hinata hadn't yet mastered her clan's most advanced techniques in Part I, in the anime, she created theProtecting Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palmsas an alternative, which effectively protects her and attacks anything within range with sharp streams of chakra emitted from her palms.[37]By Part II, she had grown accustomed to more of her clan's techniques. During Pain's Assault, Hinata could use theGentle Step Twin Lion Fists, a technique that drains the target of their chakra where struck. During the Fourth Shinobi World War, Hinata could use theEight Trigrams Vacuum Palmto attack targets outside her physical range or deflect incoming attacks,[38]which increases in power if used inconjunction with others.[39]She also mastered theEight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palmsin the war.[40]By the time she reaches adulthood, she became well-known for her mastery of the Gentle Fist.[41]As an adult, she could even knock out a target with a single strike to their tenketsu.[42][43]Hinata is also proven to be very resilient, having survived an assault by Momoshiki \\u014ctsutsuki. While Hinata doesn't usually useninjutsu, by the Fourth Shinobi World War, hernature transformationsincludedFireandLightning Release.[4]In the anime, she also demonstrated proficiency inmedical ninjutsu, able to use theMystical Palm Techniqueto heal the wounded.[44] Main article:Prologue \\u2014 Land of WavesIn the anime, while the graduates of herAcademyclass are being assigned to teams, Hinata hopes that she will be on the same team asNaruto Uzumaki. To her disappointment, she is instead added toKurenai Y\\u016bhi'sTeam 8, along withKiba InuzukaandShino Aburame. Kurenai reports this to Hinata's father,Hiashi Hy\\u016bga, but he is unconcerned and in fact abandons Hinata to Kurenai's care, feeling she is unworthy of theHy\\u016bga clan.[15] Main article:Ch\\u016bnin Exams Hinata lets Naruto copy her test. Despite how recently they graduated from the Academy, Kurenai enters Team 8 in theCh\\u016bnin Examsbeing held inKonoha; Hinata agrees to participate because she wants to change herself. For the exams' first stage, Hinata is seated next to Naruto as they take a written test. The objective in the first stage is to cheat off of other examinee's paper without getting caught, but Naruto doesn't realise this and agonises about potentially failing. Seeing this, Hinata offers to let him copy off of her paper. He suspects she's trying to trick him, but she assures him that she only wants to be helpful. Although he considers taking her up on her offer, Naruto ultimately declines, fearing that he'll get her disqualified if they're caught and claiming that, besides, he isn't the type to cheat. Although Naruto is given the opportunity to forfeit, he refuses to do so, and for his determination, he passes the first stage along with Hinata and their teams. For the second stage, participants enter theForest of Deathwith the objective of obtaining a set of two scrolls, one of which they are given at the start. Team 8 manages to collect their second scroll right after the second stage has started, and so they head for the centre of the forest where they're supposed to turn in the scrolls. Along the way, Kiba's partner,Akamaru, senses theThree Sand Siblings' fight withTeam Shigure. Team 8 watches the fight from the cover of some nearby bushes and is horrified whenGaaramercilessly kills all of Team Shigure. After they're certain Gaara won't kill them too, they proceed to the centre of the forest. After passing the second stage, the remaining participants take part in one-on-one preliminary matches. During Naruto's fight with Kiba, Hinata's loyalties are torn; she wants to cheer for Naruto, but fears that would be rude to Kiba. When Naruto wins the fight, Hinata gives both him and Kiba some of theHy\\u016bga Clan Secret Ointmentso that their wounds will heal faster. As he's being taken away to rest, Kiba pleads for Hinata to forfeit if she's matched against Gaara or her cousin,Neji Hy\\u016bga. She is indeed matched against the latter, a member of a Hy\\u016bga clan branch house who hates all members of the main house. Neji, like Kiba, tries to convince Hinata to forfeit, telling her that she's too meek and insecure to be a ninja. She begins to offer arguments in her defence, but Neji persists, claiming that she is fated to be a failure, a fact that he believes she's aware of due to her frightened reaction to what he says. Hinata fights Neji. Neji's words cause Hinata to cry, but also anger the watching Naruto, who insists that Hinata can change herself if she wants to and who encourages her to defeat Neji. Because Naruto has faith in her, Hinata refuses to forfeit and prepares to fight; Neji is surprised by the new confidence in her. Hinata and Neji exchangeGentle Fist-blows, but only Neji's are effective, which he reveals to be because he sealed hertenketsuat the start of their fight. Although her attacks are ineffective against him, Hinata continues fighting, in the process enduring mounting internal trauma from Neji's counterattacks. Neji repeatedly tells her to forfeit, but Hinata refuses, unwilling to back down both as a matter of principle and because Naruto continues to cheer for her. Hinata is saved from Neji. Neji directly attacks Hinata's heart, leading all but Naruto to believe she's been defeated. WhenHayate Gekk\\u014dis about to declare Neji the winner, Naruto stops him and motions to Hinata struggling to her feet. Neji tells her that her attempts to fight her destiny are only bringing her harm, but she rebuts that his own attempt to fight the destiny of the branch house brings him even more harm. Neji is enraged and attempts to kill her, but he is stopped by the observingj\\u014dnin. Hinata collapses, the damage to her organs being too severe, and before she loses consciousness she sees Naruto checking on her; she wonders if she managed to change at all. She's taken away by a team ofmedical-ninto be given emergency medical attention. After a month, on the day of the Ch\\u016bnin Exams' final matches, Hinata has recovered somewhat. Although she's supposed to take it easy, she practices at theThird Training Ground. Naruto stops there on his way to finals and is glad to see she's better.

He then dies from his injuries. Naruto shares Kurama's chakra with Hinata. Naruto is disheartened by the deaths of Neji and others in the Alliance. When he starts to show signs of giving up, Hinata brings him back senses by reminding him of his vow to not let any of his friends die. Although Neji may be dead, he will live on so long as others continue the fight that he gave his life for. Therefore, Naruto must stay true to the creed he has been using for so long and that she has long since adopted for herself: to not give up. Naruto's resolve is renewed and he thanks her for standing by his side.

Main article:The Last: Naruto the Movie Hinata knits Naruto's present. Two years after the war, as theRinne Festivalapproaches, Hinata decides to confess her feelings for Naruto by knitting a scarf for him, a replacement for the one he gave her when they were children. Although she completes the scarf, Hinata struggles to bring herself to give it to him, and it is only at the encouragement of Sakura and Hanabi that Hinata finally approaches Naruto. Once she finds him atRamen Ichiraku, Hinata is intimidated, first by Naruto's many otherfemale admirers, and then by the fact that he is already wearing a scarf that he clearly cherishes. Assuming she lost her chance to be with him, Hinata runs off. As she cries over the scarf alone, she is approached byToneri \\u014ctsutsuki, who requests to be given the scarf instead. He captures her with hispuppetsand they try escaping Konoha with her, but Naruto defeats the puppets and rescues her; the scarf she made is ripped in the battle. Hinata links with Naruto. In place of Hinata, Toneri is successfully able to kidnap Hanabi. Hinata requests to be added to theteamsent to rescue her. After leaving Konoha, Hinata is able to find Hanabi's trail using her Byakugan, which leads them to an underground passage. Shortly after entering the passageway, the team is trapped in agenjutsuthat dredges up old memories. While Hinata relives moments from her past that relate to Naruto, the scarf - which she's in the process of repairing - gets loose from her bag and wraps around Naruto, sharing her memories and corresponding feelings with him. Sakura is able to release them from the genjutsu and they start to continue ahead. Hinata is held back by Toneri, who expresses his desire to marry her. He explains that he has taken Hanabi's Byakugan for himself in order to carry outHamura \\u014ctsutsuki's decree to destroy the Earth, after which he can create a new world with Hinata's help. Hinata refuses to cooperate and vows to save Hanabi on her own, to which Toneri observes that she doesn't know where Hanabi is. Naruto interrupts them and defeats Toneri, who turns out to only be another puppet. Toneri tells Hinata that he'll return later for her answer. Naruto and Hinata reunite with the rest of the team and exit the underground passage, arriving in what they later discover is theMoon's interior. They split up to explore the surrounding landscape, with Naruto spending more time with Hinata. He now displays a greater interest in her thoughts and well-being, pleasing Hinata and giving her greater resolve to complete the scarf. As she is about to confide in him what Toneri told her, the rest of the team locates them and asks Hinata to look at a crypt they've found. There, Hinata is confronted by another member of the\\u014ctsutsuki clan, who shows her visions of how to stop Toneri and who introduces her to Hamura himself, who asks her to save the Earth. Naruto tells Hinata he loves her. Hinata does not share her visions with the others and starts diligently trying to complete the scarf. When they make camp later that night, Naruto confronts Hinata and assures her they will save Hanabi. He also tells her that he loves her, leaving her speechless. Rather, when Toneri comes for Hinata's answer, she gives the finished scarf to Naruto with her goodbyes and leaves with Toneri. When Naruto asks Hinata if it's a lie that she will marry Toneri, she reluctantly does not deny it. Upon seeing Naruto being hit by Toneri's attack, Toneri immediately put her to sleep. After she wakes up in Toneri's castle, Hinata checks on Hanabi to make sure she's alright and locates theTenseiganthat Toneri is using to control the Moon's movements against the Earth. She spends her time making yet another scarf, and when she has a chance she slips away to try to destroy the Tenseigan. She is found by Toneri's puppets and Toneri himself detains her. Hinata tries to reason with Toneri that Hamura never wished to destroy earth, but he doesn't listen. After which Toneri destroys the new scarf, that is actually meant for Naruto, and places her under his control. After being placed inside a picture frame, Hinata shed a tear over her regret about \\\"betraying\\\" Naruto. Hinata is forced to go through with a wedding ceremony, but as Toneri is about to kiss Hinata, Naruto interrupts the wedding. After Toneri leaves with her, Naruto is able to release her from Toneri's control, at which point she apologises to him for her earlier behaviour, though he states he already understands and forgives her. Toneri becomes distracted by his own awakeningTenseigan, allowing Hinata to escape with Naruto to the primary Tenseigan's location. Because she possesses Hamura's chakra, only Hinata is able to destroy it. However, she lacks the raw strength to do so, and must instead channel her chakra into Naruto so that they can destroy ittogether. With the Tenseigan gone, the Moon's movements stop and the puppets that the rest of the team is elsewhere fighting are rendered inert. The team reunites with them, bringing along a rescued Hanabi and the remains of Hinata's scarf. Even though it's in tatters, Naruto asks if he can have it anyway, which Hinata happily complies with. Naruto and Hinata share their first kiss. Toneri uses his own awakened Tenseigan to resume the Moon's movement towards the Earth. He then attacks them and captures Hinata, forcing her to watch as he tries to kill Naruto. Naruto ends up defeating him instead and Hinata, once freed, takes back Hanabi's eyes. Toneri tries to make one final attack and Naruto and Hinata prepare to face him together, but Toneri is knocked into space by thestatue. Naruto saves him and Toneri gives up, allowing Hinata to tell him Hamura's true wishes: to protect the Earth, not to destroy it. Toneri is repentant and remains behind when they head home, vowing not to let the Moon endanger the Earth again. As they return through the same passage they used before, Hinata asks Naruto about the scarf he's been wearing. He tells her it was a gift from hismother, causing her embarrassment that she would be jealous. Upon hearing Naruto say that he wants to spend the rest of his life with her, Hinata sheds tears of joy. As the passageway disintegrates behind them, Naruto propels himself and Hinata back to the Earth, where they share their first kiss.

Main articles:Boruto: Naruto the MovieandVersus Momoshiki ArcIn the anime, on the day of Boruto's birthday, Hinata and Himawari worked to prepare a party. While inviting different people, Hinata was sad to learn that Naruto was too busy to show up. Later that night, Naruto returned exhausted from work, to which Hinata helped him. While cleaning Naruto's office at home, Himawari discovers the jacket that Naruto used to wear, which Hinata smiles to see. Because it's Himawari's birthday, Hinata takes her out to buy food and decorations for the party later that night; they run into Boruto while they're out and he offers to carry his mother's bags. By the time they get home, they discover that Naruto is already there, having made a point to be home on time for the occasion. When Naruto later starts carrying Himawari's cake to the table to be served, he suddenly disappears, being only ashadow clone. The cake falls on the floor, making Himawari sad and Boruto angry. Hinata tries to convince Boruto that Naruto is doing the best that he can, but he leaves in anger and Hinata can only comfort Himawari. Sasuke later drops by looking for Naruto, so Hinata directs him to the Hokage office. Sakura heals Hinata in the hospital. Boruto enters theCh\\u016bnin Examsbeing held in Konoha and advances to the final round matches. While Hinata watches the fights with Himawari, Naruto approaches her and asks that she watch Boruto closely with her Byakugan. In doing so, she notices that he's using theKote, a prohibited device that forces Naruto to disqualify him and leaves her disappointed in her son. The stadium is then immediately attacked byKinshikiandMomoshiki \\u014ctsutsuki, and Hinata evacuates with the other spectators. When she learns that Naruto has been captured by Kinshiki and Momoshiki, Hinata goes after them in an effort to rescue him and is badly injured. Sakura heals her, but when she's told that Boruto plans to join Sasuke's rescue effort, she forces herself up so that she can stop him from going. When she sees him wearing Naruto's old jacket, she is reminded of his father and decides to believe in Boruto just as she always believes in Naruto. Naruto is eventually rescued and life in Konoha returns to normal. After having breakfast with her family, Hinata starts to repair the damage Boruto received to his own jacket, but he asks her not to, believing it looks \\\"cooler\\\" while damaged, much to her pleasant surprise. She and Himawari see Naruto and Boruto off at the front door, wishing them both luck with their respective days. Main article:Mitsuki's Disappearance ArcWhen Konohagakure was put on lockdown after the apparent betrayal of Mitsuki, Boruto decided to leave the village in search of the truth, convincing Sarada to join him. Hinata became deeply worried about her son and likewise apologised to Sakura for him involving Sarada. Sakura however insisted that both kids knew what penalties they would probably face with this action and was sure they would be fine, which comforted Hinata somewhat. Upon Boruto's return home, an angry and relieved Hinata joined Himawari in hugging Boruto to welcome him home. Main article:One-Tail Escort ArcIn the anime, as Hinata was preparing a family camping trip, Boruto explained that he was going on a training mission with Team 7 (unaware that Boruto was really going to find Sasuke to train with him). Later, Boruto returned to the village along with Naruto and the kettle-sealed Shukaku. WithUrashiki \\u014ctsutsukipursuing the tailed beast, it was decided that Naruto would safeguard Shukaku. During which, Hinata allowed the children to watch over the tailed beast while she was happy to have extra time with her entire family. Later, when a more proper safehouse for Shukaku was prepared, Naruto proceeded to have the tailed beast moved to it. Main article:Time Slip ArcLater, Hinata watched as an eager Boruto quickly finished his breakfast in hopes to train more with Sasuke. Hinata noted that Boruto was just like Naruto at that age, always eager to train with his mentor Jiraiya. Hinata then showed Himawari and Boruto a photo of the Sannin, who Himawari noted looked eccentric and wild. Hinata told her kids about Jiraiya's greatness as a ninja and how influential he was to Naruto, even becoming a father-figure. Later that night, Hinata found Boruto looking through Naruto's belongings for theIcha Ichaseries, hoping to learn more about Jiraiya and the \\\"wisdom\\\" it gave. After glancing at a few pages and seeing its adult content, Hinata sternly forbade Boruto from reading the books, insisting that he was too young. A young Hinata meets Boruto. Meanwhile, the grown-up Sasuke and Boruto were later sent back in time to shortly after Sasuke's defection. There, the two pretended to be travelling performers and were put under watch by Naruto. Past-Hinata met her future son, who despite her normal shy nature, felt calm and open to Boruto. Later, she and her friends helped Boruto and Naruto clean up a bathhouse after the commotion Naruto and Jiraiya caused. Days later, after Sasuke and Boruto managed to kill Urashiki and end his terror, they decided to return to their time promptly to preserve the timeline. To ensure that, Sasuke first used his Sharingan toerasethe memories of everyone he and Boruto came in contact of the recent events. Back in the present, Hiashi's birthday was fast approaching, and it was suggested by Hanabi to throw a party for him. Hinata helped Himawari pick out a scarf for him as a present. At the party, Hinata joined her family in a group photo as suggested by Boruto. Main article:Kara Actuation ArcIn the anime, Hinata was heartbroken when she heard her son was viciously defeated in battle byDeepa. As Boruto was operated on, she and Himawari watched in concern. Naruto soon arrived, equally concerned about his son. Upon seeing that he was stabilised, Naruto assured his family that Boruto was going to fine, much to Hinata's relief. After Boruto was released from the hospital and began training under Kakashi Hatake to grow stronger, while her daughter was still concerned for Boruto, Hinata insisted that Boruto was a true ninja and desired to be of true aid to others. Instead, Hinata suggested that Himawari helped cheer Boruto on by helping her mother make a bento and deliver it to him. In the following days, as Hinata continued to provide support for Boruto by bringing him lunches while training, she discovered that Sakura was growing concerned for Sarada's well-being in her own training, especially given the Uchiha's history with loss. Ino and Hinata decided to take Sakura out on a girl's night to talk. They insisted that as mothers themselves, they too fear for their children's well-being, but they have to have faith that they are strong and can endure. Their words managed to cheer up Sakura. Main article:Ao ArcIn the anime, Hinata attended the memorial service for the fallen people of the Fourth Shinobi World War, holding a portrait of Neji in his honour. Main article:Kawaki Arc Hinata welcomes Kawaki into her home. WhenBoruto's teamreturned from their mission with a mysterious boy of uniqueabilities, rather than lock him up, Naruto, sympathising as a former man-made potential weapon, decided to treat the boy as a guest to the village and let him live at his home. During which, despite Hinata treating him with kindness like any other, the rebellious boy kept seeing everyone as his enemy. He soon made his move to escape, only to be stopped by Naruto's brief show ofpower. When Boruto returned, he and the boy got into a confrontation over the latter's recent actions destroying Himawari\\u2018s personal vase, which she made as a gift to Hinata. As Himawari began cleaning up the broken pieces, the boy gruffly apologised for his unintentional mistake, introducing himself asKawaki. Later, as Kawaki attempted to find a missing fragment of the vase, Naruto doubted he would be able to find it, as Hinata cleans the house everyday. Hinata and Himawari left to shop for dinner just beforeJigenappeared in their home. Main article:Ch\\u016bnin Re-Examination ArcIn the anime, followingIsshiki \\u014ctsutsuki's defeat, a personal Ch\\u016bnin Exam for Konoha was set up. Hinata cheered on her son during the events. By the end, Boruto failed to be promoted, but Hinata happily joined her family for dinner. As Kawaki continued to show a distant nature, Hinata recognised Kawaki's efforts to open up to others, still struggling from his harsh upbringing and captivity under Kara. Main article:Great Sea Battle of Kirigakure ArcIn the anime, Hinata joined her family for a vacation to a hot spring inn won by Himawari in a raffle. She and Naruto beat Boruto and Kawaki at ping-pong with their superior team-work, Hinata in particular being an excellent player. Main article:Kawaki & Himawari Academy ArcIn the anime, Hinata was glad to hear that Himawari was having a good time in the Academy. Later, she was surprised to learn that Himawari had not actually decided on becoming a shinobi, but rather saw the Academy as an opportunity to learn about herself and meet people. Hinata and Naruto were happy to see how maturely Himawari was taking her experiences. Main article:Code's Assault Arc Hinata and her family welcome Kawaki with a feast. After Jigen, leader ofKara, was able to infiltrate Konoha and critically injured Naruto and Sasuke in an attempt to reclaim Kawaki, Hinata and her family were relieved when Naruto made a quick recovery. Later, following Isshiki's permanent death, they decided to throw a welcome dinner party for Kawaki, to show he was truly welcomed in the Uzumaki home. While Kawaki asked to throw away a box of old magazines, Hinata watched a movie with Naruto with emotion. Later, Boruto rushed in to alert his parents that Kawaki had evaded surveillance and left the village. When learning that Boruto and Kawaki were in trouble, Hinata was determined to help her husband in the rescue, only to be reminded that she needed to look after Himawari should the worst happen. She reluctantly conceded, praying for all of them to return safely. Main article:Omnipotence ArcWhen Boruto was called in for his first mission in a long time, Hinata cried, worried that this time he might not come back, despite his assurance he would return. After he left, Himawari told her she could help Boruto if she became a shinobi, and asked if it would make her worry more instead. Hinata slaps Kawaki. While preparing for dinner with Naruto, she wished that Boruto and Kawaki could join them, asking Naruto how long their mission could take. Having left the house, Kawaki joined them, wishing to talk to Naruto. Kawaki told them how much Naruto meant to him, and how far he was willing to go to get rid of all \\u014ctsutsuki, Boruto included. Hinata was hurt by it and slapped Kawaki. He conceded he might be insane for what he was willing to do, and sent them away with a rift to stop them from interfering, willing to bear their hate and welcoming them to kill him when he was done. Naruto and Hinata were kept inDaikokuten, suspended in time, unable to think, age, and requiring no air or sustenance. Main article:Boruto's Return Arc Naruto and Hinata trapped in Kawaki's Dimension. Three years later, Kawaki visited the unconscious Hinata and Naruto. Main article:Naruto Shipp\\u016bden the MovieAsTeam 7heads to theFifth Hokage's office, they cross paths with Hinata and Shino. Main article:Naruto Shipp\\u016bden the Movie: BondsFollowing an attack on Konoha by theLand of the Sky, Naruto, Hinata, and Sakura are assigned to escortAmaruandShinn\\u014dback to their village. When they reach the village, they find it destroyed and Amaru, in her anguish, triggers a booby trap that. Shinn\\u014d saves Amaru, but is apparently badly wounded and seemingly dies, which Hinata confirms with her Byakugan. The rest of them split up to investigate the area and Hinata is captured, imprisoned with the rest of the villagers. Amaru later finds them, frees them, and evacuates them to safety. Main article:Naruto Shipp\\u016bden the Movie: The Will of FireWhen Naruto and Sakura go searching for the apparentlymissing-ninKakashi, Hinata is part of a team organised to stop them and bring them back to Konoha. Although they do manage to find Naruto and Sakura, they are attacked byHiruko's henchmen; the members of Team 8 end up fightingNiand her chimera-dogs. Although they defeat her, Nifuseswith her teammates,IchiandSan, into a massive flying beast. As the rest of the Konoha 11 distracts the beast, Hinata and Neji use theirGentle Fistto destroy it. Hiruko repairs the beast, forcing the Konoha 11 to pool their attacks against it; Hinata and Neji's contribution is theEight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms. The beast and Hiruko are ultimately destroyed. Main article:Naruto the Movie: Blood PrisonHinata is part of the team sent to theBlood Prisonto rescue Naruto, who was wrongly imprisoned there. She becomes worried when he is impaled, and is accordingly relieved when he is rescued byRy\\u016bzetsu. Main article:Road to Ninja: Naruto the MovieHinata and the rest of the Konoha 11 fight off an attack by what seems to be the entireAkatsukiroster, but what are actually disguised parts of theWhite Zetsu Army. When Naruto and Sakura are sent to theGenjutsu World, they meet that world's Hinata: she is dressed provocatively and is more assertive and confident in herself. She is aggressively infatuated with the Genjutsu World'sNaruto, to the point of threatening any girl who is with him; Sakura becomes frightened by Hinata's threat to kill her for \\\"flirting\\\" with Naruto. Hinata Hy\\u016bga is a playable character in the following video games: In later instalments of theClash of Ninjaseries, Hinata is playable in an \\\"awakened\\\" form. In this form, her clothes are similar to what she wore during theBik\\u014dch\\u016b Search Mission, though the form itself is not based on the events of that arc. Awakened Hinata has a personality similar to Neji's during the Ch\\u016bnin Exams, arrogantly challenging opponents and boasting about the power of the main branch of the Hy\\u016bga clan. While in this form, she is also able to use techniques such asEight Trigrams Sixty-Four PalmsandEight Trigrams Palms Revolving Heaven. MostClash of Ninjagames require that this awakened Hinata be selected separately, but inClash of Ninja Revolution 3, normal Hinata can transform into her in the middle of battle by activating her Byakugan. A similar form appears inUltimate Ninja 2, dubbed \\\"Byakugan Hinata\\\", with the main difference being she wears the traditional Hy\\u016bga attire. In several of theUltimate Ninja Stormgames, the team combination of Hinata and Naruto is titled \\\"Secret Lovers\\\" or \\\"Joined Hands\\\". Hinata is featured in the online game,Fortnite, in her Part II outfit as a playable skin.\",\n          \"Back in her childhood, as a result of her clan's high expectations as their heiress and her father, Hiashi's grueling training, being overshadowed by her younger sister, Hanabi, and Hiashi deeming her as a failure, Hinata had become very timid and lacked self-confidence. However, she has shown to be a very hard worker (something that her father initially failed to notice), as she continuously strove to change herself for the better, though initially this lack of self-confidence would hinder her on even missions. As the series progressed, Hinata became more open about her opinion and confident overall, as she demonstrated a willingness on occasion to take decisive action than ever before. By the time of theFourth Shinobi World War, her bravery and confidence has extended to the part where she is willing to put her own life on the line for her village, friends, and family. The strongest amount of Hinata's newfound confidence and bravery was displayed after Neji had died where, although shedding tears for her cousin's death, she was able to pull herself together, and even preventObito Uchihafrom breaking Naruto's spirit. Hinata's growing self-confidence mainly comes from her long-standing admiration for Naruto, as she was inspired by his enthusiasm and his unyielding determination to never give up no matter what the odds. In the beginning, Hinata was very shy around Naruto, constantly blushing and stuttering when talking with him. However, as Hinata's confidence in herself grows she gradually becomes more confident with herself and her desire to gain Naruto's affections. As the series progressed, her admiration towards him grew into genuine care and affection, eventually leading her to fall in love with him. Hinata also has an unshakeable faith in Naruto, believing that he will one day achieve his goal of becoming Hokage. DuringPain's assaulton Konoha, Hinata finally confessed her love to Naruto and was also willing to risk her life to protect him; Hinata realised that she was much weaker than Pain - who was uncharacteristically surprised by her efforts - yet she still was courageous enough to defend Naruto and enable his freedom from the chakra rods. After Neji was killed by Obito, she pulled herself together despite the pain she was feeling so she could inspire Naruto once more to not give up on himself, reiterating their sharednind\\u014d, showing how far she has come. Her feelings for Naruto have ultimately become her greatest desire, simply to be together with Naruto, as shown through theInfinite Tsukuyomi. This desire would finally become a reality years after the war, when Hinata and Naruto got married and started a family of their own, with two children that she like her husband, loves dearly. Ironically, when Naruto began to realize his love for her, she was oblivious to it like he was to her that it took him accidentally confessing to her to realize it. By the end of Part I, Hinata was able to foster better relations with both Neji and her father and started training with them, as well as growing closer and stronger together as a family. She is especially caring towards her little sister, Hanabi, to the point where she was hesitant to hurt her, even during their match to determine the heir to their clan. Two years after the Fourth Shinobi World War, when Hanabi was captured byToneri \\u014ctsutsuki, she went to great lengths to save her such as \\\"agreeing\\\" to marry Toneri, but in truth, it was a ruse; in spite of Hinata's hatred of having to deceive Naruto, she was able to be pragmatic for the sake of her sister and world itself, which demanded her to avoid raising Toneri's suspicions. After Toneri was seemingly foiled, Hinata emphatically apologised to Naruto for the deception, while he likewise apologised for failing to understand her tactics at first; though neither Hinata nor Naruto felt anger or merely annoyance over each other, due to both being incredibly forgiving inherently, and both grateful for their love too much to be concerned. Hinata is also the closest to her sensei Kurenai, who is not only interested in Hinata's growth as a ninja but also as a person. She knows Hinata's personal struggles and unlike her demanding father, Kurenai tries her best to coach Hinata in ways in which she knows her pupil will best respond. After Hinata was knocked down for the final time by Neji in theCh\\u016bnin Exams, Kurenai silently congratulated her student's resolve and perseverance. Kurenai is aware of her affection for Naruto and encourages her to express herself to him; Kurenai would also act as her pupil's support in person when Hinata was struggling to other healing ointment to Naruto. Hinata gets along well with her teammates. Kiba has become one of her closest friends, and his actions toward her are often motivated by his concern for her, such as when he urged her to forfeit if she was matched against Neji or Gaara during the Ch\\u016bnin Exams. Kiba is also aware of her feelings for Naruto, as he tends to tease her a lot about them by embarrassing her by telling her Naruto is near when he is not or pointing out when she blushes when thinking about Naruto. Shino possesses a quiet confidence in Hinata, and will make a point of assuring others when they doubt or worry about her; both Kiba and Shino hold a brotherly attachment to Hinata, thus they are both protective and encouraging of her. Perhaps due to her shyness and insecurity from being considered a failure, Hinata also had self-esteem issues in her appearance. By the time she was 16, she had become noticeably beautiful, however, her attire was either formal Hyuga ware, or most commonly her ninja uniform that was so baggy it hid her features. Granted, a not mutually exclusive factor could be that she was aware of her growth, but felt so self-conscious that she took steps to hide that fact; in the bathhouse, she became really self-conscious when other girls complimented her development. By the time she was 18, her experiences had built up her confidence so that her ninja outfit was more form-fitting and revealed her arms, in contrast to her original overly long sleeves. Ironically, her loss of insecurity coincided with Naruto's realisation that he loved her, thus he bashfully pointed out the relatively revealing style of her outfit, which she no longer considered an issue. While originally becoming overwhelmed by bashfulness and nerves to even be in the presence of Naruto, eventually, as her confidence grew over time, she was able to interact with him without stammering or passing out anymore; although, should there be somewhat lengthy separations, her prior shyness would return to an extent. Hinata was able to fearlessly confess her love during her fight against Pain, however, the life-threatening status of the situation, and presumption of death, likely gave her the push - if not adrenaline boost - to ignore her usual shy nature. Although, years later even at 18 years old, if she actually tried to express her feelings for him again, but during an everyday scenario, she would blush and be easily deterred; despite her hesitation being connected to her self-esteem, it was also simply her love being unconditional, since she only wanted Naruto to be happy, and although personally sad, she would selflessly support his happiness overall, even it were with another girl. After becoming a mother, Hinata became more mature and seemingly gained a stricter side, having to remind her children not to run outside barefoot when embracing their father. Furthermore, her heightened strictness has allowed her to keep both Naruto and Boruto in line, with the latter being fearful of incurring Hinata's anger. However, she is not above joining in their fun, such as having a snowball fight with them and her husband, and acts as a wise and supportive figure for her family. She does have some remnants of her old bashful self, such as when reminiscing about her past with Naruto, she falls into daydreaming until someone interjects, which makes her slightly embarrassment. Hinata's variant in the genjutsu world inRoad to Ninja: Naruto the Movie, like most has a vastly opposite personality. She is abrasive, ill-tempered, mean-spirited, violent, arrogant, and aggressively possessive of Menma (Naruto's alternate self). Unlike the regular world, she is the most dominant of the Hyuga, causing the bumbling Neji to become terrified of her anger. She also flaunts her beauty now, with her routine outfit, but now with shorts and the coat is unzipped to reveal a mesh midriff top. The only main personality continuation is her love for Menma/Naruto, although her possessiveness drives her to dangerous jealousy. Hinata has dark blue hair and fair skin - traits that she inherited from hermother. She also has the customary white eyes of her clan, which have a tinge of lavender in the anime. She is usually seen with a timid, shy expression in Part I, but less so in Part II, with the exception of when she is around Naruto. Like the rest of her clan, she possesses the renownedByakuganwhich, when activated, stimulates the veins and arteries immediately around her eyes to protrude much more prominently. In Part I, her hair was in a short, leveled hime-cut style just above her forehead, with chin-length strands framing her face. She wore a cream-coloured hooded-jacket with a fire symbol on the upper right and left sleeves and fur around the cuffs and hem, with navy blue pants. After earning her genin rank, she wore her Konohaforehead protectoraround her neck. At the Ch\\u016bnin Exams finals, Hinata wore a long-sleeved, light blue blouse with a high collar, and dark blue pants. While at home, she was seen in the traditional Hy\\u016bga garb, consisting of a simple, loose-fitting robe with different colored trimmings, and an under-shirt. In Part II, Hinata retained her straight, hime-style haircut, but she had let her hair grow to reach her lower back, while the short strands that frame her face had grown to shoulder-length. Her figure had also grown to become much womanlier. She also donned an attire comprised of a loose-fitting, lavender and cream hooded jacket with lavender cuffs over mesh armor with navy blue pants and black, low-heeled sandals. Although she still wore her forehead protector around her neck, its color had changed from blue to black. In one of theomakes, she was seen wearing a beige apron and light blue scarf tied in a bandana style. In another omake, she was seen in a casual outfit that consisted of brown capri pants, brown sandals, and a dark green, hood-less jacket with a fire symbol on the upper-right side of her chest. The cuffs of the jacket were rolled up to the middle of her forearms; the inside of the jacket was shown to be cream-colored. Hinata had a light lavender blouse underneath. During the Fourth Shinobi World War, she donned the standard uniform of her village inclusive offlak jacket. Instead of wearing the forehead protector of theAllied Shinobi Forces, she has seemingly opted not to wear one at all. Two years afterthe Fourth Shinobi World War at age 18, Hinata changed her previous outfit to a slightly more revealing and form-fitting one. She is now seen wearing a light lavender, sleeveless kimono-style blouse with vertical lines, tied with a dark purple obi around her waist. She wears a pair of short dark navy shorts with thigh-high stockings, revealing parts of her upper thighs, and has changed her regular ninja sandals to black high-heeled boots. Hinata's hair increase slightly in volume and grows to hip-length. She also no longer wears her forehead protector. While off-duty, she wears a grey long-sleeved shirt underneath a pink shirt, black pants underneath a long cream-coloured skirt with pink horizontal stripes, and a pair of brown sandals. She is also seen wearing a lavender hooded jacket. After Hinata was brainwashed by Toneri during their marriage ceremony, she wore a black long and sleeveless dress with a high collar and matching long gloves. She also wore a blackturbanwith a black and light-yellow veil over, and yellow crescent moon earrings. After she marries Naruto and becomes a mother, Hinata has cut her hair and bangs to shoulder-length. Her attire consists of a maroon jacket with a dark purple shirt and a cream-coloured skirt. She also wears a pair of lavender slippers. Years later, Hinata has let her hair grow long again, and ties it in a ponytail now. She also dons an outfit that consists of a long-sleeved, collared white shirt, lavender dress, and blue pants. Hinata was born on December 27 and is the first daughter of Hiashi, who is the leader of the clan, and his unnamed wife. She has a younger sister named Hanabi and a cousin namedNeji. Hinata is described as a weakling in the clan because of her sweet and gentle nature in which her father fears that she is not fit to be the next heir to the clan and that her sister who is only about five years younger can surpass her. Hinata does her very best to become strong and she trains very hard to impress her father. Hinata has both feelings and admiration for Naruto who gives her the confidence to work very hard. She was later taken in byKurenai Y\\u016bhiwho became her sensei, and she later became part of the Rookie 9. During the Chunin Exams, she fought against her cousin Neji with Naruto cheering her on and giving her the courage to never back down, even though she was severely wounded. She is now on good terms with her clan, especially with Neji, who has become her protector, and later watched Naruto depart with Jiraiya on his two-year training so that he can get Sasuke back after he, the retrieval team, Rock Lee, and the three sand siblings previously failed due to the interference of Kimimaro. Hinata Hyuga (Shippuden) In Part II, Hinata is 16 years old and is now a full-level Chunin. When Naruto came back home for the first time after his journey, Hinata blushed and fainted. Hinata was assigned with her team along with Team Kakashi to look for Sasuke. Hinata along with Naruto and Yamato split up together until they were confronted by Kabuto Yakushi who gave them a book that had records and all the information about the Akatsuki members. Before Kabuto left, Hinata used her Byakugan and noticed that 33 percent of Kabuto's body is being covered with Orochimaru's flesh. Later, Hinata met up with her team and they encountered Tobi who delayed their search. Hinata used her Byakugan to help guide her team in finding Tobi. After hearing the news thatSasukedefeatedItachi, Tobi disappeared and Hinata used her Byakugan to help her team follow him. Hinata discovered that there were black flames (Amaterasu) burning where Sasuke and Itachi had their final battle, and the team rushed to investigate only to find that Tobi got there before they did and took Sasuke with him. Later, Pain invaded Konoha and Hinata helped tend to the citizens to escape the wreckage and heal the wounded. Hinata witnessed Naruto fighting Pain with her Byakugan and noticed that Naruto was starting to lose to Pain and was pinned down by him. Despite Naruto's orders not to get involved in his battle, Hinata rushed to Naruto's aid to defend Naruto. Naruto asked her why she was throwing her life away and she told him that she was doing it because she loved him, which shocked Naruto. In the manga, Hinata used herTwin Lion Fiststo attack Pain, but Pain simply dodged the attack, threw her down, and used his Chakra Sensor Rod and stab her. In the anime, she was able to hit the Deva Path with herTwin Lion Fistsand Pain used hisShinra Tenseito subdue her, but Hinata was able to stand up and continue to fight. She was able to crawl over to Naruto and remove the Chakra sensor Rod from Naruto's hand. While her nindo way was echoing in Naruto's head, Naruto watched as Pain stabbed Hinata. In both of these versions, it caused Naruto to snap and release the Eight-TailedKuramawhile the weakened Hinata watched on. Hinata was taken away from the team with Sakura healing her. Later, a relieved Hinata celebrated with the villagers on Naruto's victory of defeating Nagato and she smiled softly as the worried Sakura hugged and thanked Naruto. to be added to be added Originally, Hinata was considered weak due to her gentle personality which hindered her performance which deemed her unworthy for her role as the clan heiress. After committing herself to training to become stronger for Naruto, she received praise from her team and her clan for improving her skills and strengthening character. Two years after the war, Hinata was recognized byHamura \\u014ctsutsukias the Byakugan Princess proved to be crucial in the destruction of the Tenseigan, although she could not destroy it herself. Despite spending at least, a decade as a housewife she was able to survive an attempt to get Naruto back fromMomoshiki \\u014ctsutsukiand defeat Hanabi who is an active j\\u014dnin and continues training to become the next clan leader, in a sparring match. Hinata at the time was reluctant to fight and unprepared when Hanabi was attacking seriously. Despite being rusty, she was able to keep up and win against Hanabi. From special clan training, Hinata has very advanced chakra control. Hinata did additional training and expanded on it during Part I; one product of this training was to make Water Needles by forming her chakra around her from nearby water sources and be used as a projectile. By Part II of the anime, Hinata's control has advanced enough to match a medical-nin. which was the reason she was assigned to help perform the Four-Corner Sealing Barrier. When meeting Hamura, she inherited some of his charka because she is a member of the main house of the Hy\\u016bga clan. Its strength and purity of her chakra attractsToneri \\u014ctsutsuki. Because she is a member of the main house of the Hy\\u016bga clan and a direct bloodline from Hamura she could come into contact and find the Tenseigan. Though she could not destroy it herself, she instead held Naruto's hand to give him allowance to touch the Tenseigan and for him to destroy it, since anyone who does not have the bloodline of a Hy\\u016bga and \\u014ctsutsuki cannot touch it. As a Hy\\u016bga, Hinata possesses the Byakugan, which grants her penetrative vision in a near-360\\u00b0 around herself, with a blind spot at the back of the neck above the first thoracic vertebra. With it, she is able to assist others frequently in tracking, and scouting the area for their target(s); by focusing her vision on a single direction, Hinata can see across distances, reaching as far as 20 kilometers by the battle against Toneri. Hinata's Byakugan grants her attacks with pinpoint accuracies, which she can share with others to also improve their own.

She also wears navy blue pants and keeps herforehead protectorloosely around her neck. In Part II, she dons a lavender and cream hooded-jacket with lavender cuffs over mesh armour. She also wears navy blue pants, black, low-heeled sandals, and changes the cloth of her forehead protector from blue to black. Hinata switches to the standard Konoha infantryflak jacketand assorted clothing during the Fourth Shinobi World War, though she does not appear to wear a forehead protector. Two years after the war, Hinata's mission attire is a form-fitting light lavender, sleeveless kimono-style blouse with vertical lines, tied with a dark purple obi around her waist and short dark navy shorts. She also wore thigh-high stockings with black, open-toed boots. She does not wear her forehead protector at all. Her outfits become more varied after that, changing to match the occasion or simply being more casual than her prior garb. During Hinata's and Toneri's wedding, she wore a wide black and grey top with a long grey sash around her waist. She also wore short puffy pants with black lace socks and sandals. On her head was a black turban with a black and light yellow veil over and yellow crescent moon earrings. During Hinata's and Naruto's wedding, she wore a traditional white kimono with a flower in her hair. After getting married, she consistently wears a light purple short-sleeved jacket, a long-sleeved white shirt with a two pink coloured strips underneath it, light brown shorts and purple open-toed boots. In theBorutomanga, Hinata has a necklace with the Uzumaki symbol on it. She also wears her wedding ring on her left hand and has her hair cut into a short bob style with fringes covering the top of her forehead. Hinata repelling a Ten-Tails mini-clone with the Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms. Originally, Hinata's gentle personality hindered her performance, to which she was deemed too weak and unworthy for the role of heir.[26]After committing herself getting stronger in her training for Naruto, receiving consistent praise from her team and clan for her improving skills and strengthening character.[27][20][18]Two years after the war, Hinata, having been recognised byHamura \\u014ctsutsukias the Byakugan Princess, proves to be crucial in the destruction of theTenseigan, even though she herself can't destroy it.[7] Over a decade later, while rusty as she retired to be a housewife, Hinata's prowess still remained formidable. Despite being unprepared and reluctant to fight Hanabi, an active j\\u014dnin who continues training to become the next Hy\\u016bga clan leader, Hinata decisively defeated her sister in a match.[28] Hinata's Gentle Step: Twin Lion Fist using Hamura's chakra. From her special clan training, Hinata has advanced control of her chakra. In the anime, Hinata's additional training during Part I resulted in her ability to free herself from contraints[29]and manipulate nearby water sources, turning them intoprojectiles.[30]By Part II of the anime, Hinata's control has advanced enough to match amedical-nin's, for which reason she is assigned to help perform theFour-Corner Sealing Barrier. When she met Hamura, Hinata inherited some of hischakrabecause she is a member of the Hy\\u016bga clan's main house. It is the strength and purity of her chakra that attractsToneri \\u014ctsutsuki. It is also because of her being the member of the Hy\\u016bga clan's main house and direct bloodline from Hamura that she can touch and find the Tenseigan, though she can't destroy it by herself, so instead she held Naruto's hand to give him allowance to touch the Tenseigan and for him to destroy it, since anyone without the Hy\\u016bga and\\u014ctsutsukibloodline can't touch it. Hinata's Byakugan. As a Hy\\u016bga, Hinata possesses the Byakugan, ad\\u014djutsuthat grants her penetrative vision in a near-360\\u00b0 around herself, with one blind spot at the back of the neck above the firstthoracic vertebra.[31]With it, she is able to assist others frequently in tracking, scouting the area for their target(s); by focusing her vision in a single direction, Hinata can see across vast distances, able to see at least 1 kilometre during her first Ch\\u016bnin Exam, and reaching as far away as 20 kilometres by the battle against Toneri. Hinata's Byakugan grants her attacks pinpoint accuracy, which she can share with others to also improve their own.[32]She can also use it in order to identifygenjutsu, searching for the caster in the nearby area.[33]In the anime, Hinata can useinfraredvision and magnify in to see tiny targets.[34]By adulthood, the chakra sensitivity provided by the Byakugan allows her to pick up on the slightest presence of chakra.[35] As is traditional in her clan, Hinata has been extensively trained in theGentle Fistfighting style. In unison with her Byakugan, Hinata can attack accurately target an individuals'chakra pathway systemsand the 361tenketsuthat run along it, constricting or cutting off their chakra flow from only minimal contact.[15]Although this enables Hinata to attack an opponent's internal organs, she can also use it in a supplementary function, such as by setting dislocated shoulders back in place.[36] Hinata and Neji combining their Eight Trigrams Vacuum Palms. While Hinata hadn't yet mastered her clan's most advanced techniques in Part I, in the anime, she created theProtecting Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palmsas an alternative, which effectively protects her and attacks anything within range with sharp streams of chakra emitted from her palms.[37]By Part II, she had grown accustomed to more of her clan's techniques. During Pain's Assault, Hinata could use theGentle Step Twin Lion Fists, a technique that drains the target of their chakra where struck. During the Fourth Shinobi World War, Hinata could use theEight Trigrams Vacuum Palmto attack targets outside her physical range or deflect incoming attacks,[38]which increases in power if used inconjunction with others.[39]She also mastered theEight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palmsin the war.[40]By the time she reaches adulthood, she became well-known for her mastery of the Gentle Fist.[41]As an adult, she could even knock out a target with a single strike to their tenketsu.[42][43]Hinata is also proven to be very resilient, having survived an assault by Momoshiki \\u014ctsutsuki. While Hinata doesn't usually useninjutsu, by the Fourth Shinobi World War, hernature transformationsincludedFireandLightning Release.[4]In the anime, she also demonstrated proficiency inmedical ninjutsu, able to use theMystical Palm Techniqueto heal the wounded.[44] Main article:Prologue \\u2014 Land of WavesIn the anime, while the graduates of herAcademyclass are being assigned to teams, Hinata hopes that she will be on the same team asNaruto Uzumaki. To her disappointment, she is instead added toKurenai Y\\u016bhi'sTeam 8, along withKiba InuzukaandShino Aburame. Kurenai reports this to Hinata's father,Hiashi Hy\\u016bga, but he is unconcerned and in fact abandons Hinata to Kurenai's care, feeling she is unworthy of theHy\\u016bga clan.[15] Main article:Ch\\u016bnin Exams Hinata lets Naruto copy her test. Despite how recently they graduated from the Academy, Kurenai enters Team 8 in theCh\\u016bnin Examsbeing held inKonoha; Hinata agrees to participate because she wants to change herself. For the exams' first stage, Hinata is seated next to Naruto as they take a written test. The objective in the first stage is to cheat off of other examinee's paper without getting caught, but Naruto doesn't realise this and agonises about potentially failing. Seeing this, Hinata offers to let him copy off of her paper. He suspects she's trying to trick him, but she assures him that she only wants to be helpful. Although he considers taking her up on her offer, Naruto ultimately declines, fearing that he'll get her disqualified if they're caught and claiming that, besides, he isn't the type to cheat. Although Naruto is given the opportunity to forfeit, he refuses to do so, and for his determination, he passes the first stage along with Hinata and their teams. For the second stage, participants enter theForest of Deathwith the objective of obtaining a set of two scrolls, one of which they are given at the start. Team 8 manages to collect their second scroll right after the second stage has started, and so they head for the centre of the forest where they're supposed to turn in the scrolls. Along the way, Kiba's partner,Akamaru, senses theThree Sand Siblings' fight withTeam Shigure. Team 8 watches the fight from the cover of some nearby bushes and is horrified whenGaaramercilessly kills all of Team Shigure. After they're certain Gaara won't kill them too, they proceed to the centre of the forest. After passing the second stage, the remaining participants take part in one-on-one preliminary matches. During Naruto's fight with Kiba, Hinata's loyalties are torn; she wants to cheer for Naruto, but fears that would be rude to Kiba. When Naruto wins the fight, Hinata gives both him and Kiba some of theHy\\u016bga Clan Secret Ointmentso that their wounds will heal faster. As he's being taken away to rest, Kiba pleads for Hinata to forfeit if she's matched against Gaara or her cousin,Neji Hy\\u016bga. She is indeed matched against the latter, a member of a Hy\\u016bga clan branch house who hates all members of the main house. Neji, like Kiba, tries to convince Hinata to forfeit, telling her that she's too meek and insecure to be a ninja. She begins to offer arguments in her defence, but Neji persists, claiming that she is fated to be a failure, a fact that he believes she's aware of due to her frightened reaction to what he says. Hinata fights Neji. Neji's words cause Hinata to cry, but also anger the watching Naruto, who insists that Hinata can change herself if she wants to and who encourages her to defeat Neji. Because Naruto has faith in her, Hinata refuses to forfeit and prepares to fight; Neji is surprised by the new confidence in her. Hinata and Neji exchangeGentle Fist-blows, but only Neji's are effective, which he reveals to be because he sealed hertenketsuat the start of their fight. Although her attacks are ineffective against him, Hinata continues fighting, in the process enduring mounting internal trauma from Neji's counterattacks. Neji repeatedly tells her to forfeit, but Hinata refuses, unwilling to back down both as a matter of principle and because Naruto continues to cheer for her. Hinata is saved from Neji. Neji directly attacks Hinata's heart, leading all but Naruto to believe she's been defeated. WhenHayate Gekk\\u014dis about to declare Neji the winner, Naruto stops him and motions to Hinata struggling to her feet. Neji tells her that her attempts to fight her destiny are only bringing her harm, but she rebuts that his own attempt to fight the destiny of the branch house brings him even more harm. Neji is enraged and attempts to kill her, but he is stopped by the observingj\\u014dnin. Hinata collapses, the damage to her organs being too severe, and before she loses consciousness she sees Naruto checking on her; she wonders if she managed to change at all. She's taken away by a team ofmedical-ninto be given emergency medical attention. After a month, on the day of the Ch\\u016bnin Exams' final matches, Hinata has recovered somewhat. Although she's supposed to take it easy, she practices at theThird Training Ground. Naruto stops there on his way to finals and is glad to see she's better. Because he's scheduled to fight Neji, Naruto shares his concerns that he might not be strong enough to defeat him. Hinata says that she believes he is strong enough, and that even if he isn't physically strong he still has strength of perseverance: a willingness to keep trying despite apparent failure until he finally conquers his obstacle. She admires him for that. Naruto is put at ease, thanks her, and informs her that his impression of her as \\\"weird\\\" was wrong, as he actually likes her. Hinata is left speechless as he walks away. Hinata watches Naruto's fight against Neji with Kiba. Seeing Naruto receive so many of Neji's attacks upsets Hinata and causes her internal injuries to begin bleeding again. Kiba gets anAnbu(Kabuto Yakushi) to treat her. Although the Anbu heals her, she is rendered unconscious and thus is unable to watch Naruto's defeat of Neji.

Naruto sees her, though he doesn't realise it's Hinata; she becomes embarrassed when he later tells Kiba about the \\\"beautiful girl\\\" he saw. When they are attacked by members of theKamizuru clan, Hinata uses her newProtecting Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palmsto save her team.

When Hinata was summoned to a meeting with theFifth Hokage, she was hopeful that she would also get sent on such a mission.

Therefore, Naruto must stay true to the creed he has been using for so long and that she has long since adopted for herself: to not give up. Naruto's resolve is renewed and he thanks her for standing by his side. He then takes her hand and transfers some chakra to her, giving her aversion 1-like shroud that protects her and augments her attacks against the Ten-Tails.

Hinata explains that she saw the Ten-Tails being absorbed into Obito, meaning he has become itsjinch\\u016briki. Because of the abilities this grants Obito, Hinata and most of the rest of the Alliance stand no chance against him and must leave the fighting to others such as Naruto and Sasuke. But Hinata remains alert for opportunities to contribute and pitches in when they emerge, first by joining the rest of the Konoha 11 in hitting Obito with one of Naruto'sRasengan, and then by assisting the rest of the Alliance with pulling the tailed beasts' chakra from Obito's body.

Main article:The Last: Naruto the Movie Hinata knits Naruto's present. Two years after the war, as theRinne Festivalapproaches, Hinata decides to confess her feelings for Naruto by knitting a scarf for him, a replacement for the one he gave her when they were children. Although she completes the scarf, Hinata struggles to bring herself to give it to him, and it is only at the encouragement of Sakura and Hanabi that Hinata finally approaches Naruto. Once she finds him atRamen Ichiraku, Hinata is intimidated, first by Naruto's many otherfemale admirers, and then by the fact that he is already wearing a scarf that he clearly cherishes. Assuming she lost her chance to be with him, Hinata runs off. As she cries over the scarf alone, she is approached byToneri \\u014ctsutsuki, who requests to be given the scarf instead. He captures her with hispuppetsand they try escaping Konoha with her, but Naruto defeats the puppets and rescues her; the scarf she made is ripped in the battle. Hinata links with Naruto. In place of Hinata, Toneri is successfully able to kidnap Hanabi. Hinata requests to be added to theteamsent to rescue her. After leaving Konoha, Hinata is able to find Hanabi's trail using her Byakugan, which leads them to an underground passage. Shortly after entering the passageway, the team is trapped in agenjutsuthat dredges up old memories. While Hinata relives moments from her past that relate to Naruto, the scarf - which she's in the process of repairing - gets loose from her bag and wraps around Naruto, sharing her memories and corresponding feelings with him. Sakura is able to release them from the genjutsu and they start to continue ahead. Hinata is held back by Toneri, who expresses his desire to marry her. He explains that he has taken Hanabi's Byakugan for himself in order to carry outHamura \\u014ctsutsuki's decree to destroy the Earth, after which he can create a new world with Hinata's help. Hinata refuses to cooperate and vows to save Hanabi on her own, to which Toneri observes that she doesn't know where Hanabi is. Naruto interrupts them and defeats Toneri, who turns out to only be another puppet. Toneri tells Hinata that he'll return later for her answer. Naruto and Hinata reunite with the rest of the team and exit the underground passage, arriving in what they later discover is theMoon's interior. They split up to explore the surrounding landscape, with Naruto spending more time with Hinata. He now displays a greater interest in her thoughts and well-being, pleasing Hinata and giving her greater resolve to complete the scarf. As she is about to confide in him what Toneri told her, the rest of the team locates them and asks Hinata to look at a crypt they've found. There, Hinata is confronted by another member of the\\u014ctsutsuki clan, who shows her visions of how to stop Toneri and who introduces her to Hamura himself, who asks her to save the Earth. Naruto tells Hinata he loves her. Hinata does not share her visions with the others and starts diligently trying to complete the scarf. When they make camp later that night, Naruto confronts Hinata and assures her they will save Hanabi. He also tells her that he loves her, leaving her speechless. Rather, when Toneri comes for Hinata's answer, she gives the finished scarf to Naruto with her goodbyes and leaves with Toneri. When Naruto asks Hinata if it's a lie that she will marry Toneri, she reluctantly does not deny it. Upon seeing Naruto being hit by Toneri's attack, Toneri immediately put her to sleep. After she wakes up in Toneri's castle, Hinata checks on Hanabi to make sure she's alright and locates theTenseiganthat Toneri is using to control the Moon's movements against the Earth. She spends her time making yet another scarf, and when she has a chance she slips away to try to destroy the Tenseigan. She is found by Toneri's puppets and Toneri himself detains her. Hinata tries to reason with Toneri that Hamura never wished to destroy earth, but he doesn't listen. After which Toneri destroys the new scarf, that is actually meant for Naruto, and places her under his control. After being placed inside a picture frame, Hinata shed a tear over her regret about \\\"betraying\\\" Naruto. Hinata is forced to go through with a wedding ceremony, but as Toneri is about to kiss Hinata, Naruto interrupts the wedding. After Toneri leaves with her, Naruto is able to release her from Toneri's control, at which point she apologises to him for her earlier behaviour, though he states he already understands and forgives her. Toneri becomes distracted by his own awakeningTenseigan, allowing Hinata to escape with Naruto to the primary Tenseigan's location. Because she possesses Hamura's chakra, only Hinata is able to destroy it. However, she lacks the raw strength to do so, and must instead channel her chakra into Naruto so that they can destroy ittogether. With the Tenseigan gone, the Moon's movements stop and the puppets that the rest of the team is elsewhere fighting are rendered inert. The team reunites with them, bringing along a rescued Hanabi and the remains of Hinata's scarf. Even though it's in tatters, Naruto asks if he can have it anyway, which Hinata happily complies with. Naruto and Hinata share their first kiss. Toneri uses his own awakened Tenseigan to resume the Moon's movement towards the Earth. He then attacks them and captures Hinata, forcing her to watch as he tries to kill Naruto. Naruto ends up defeating him instead and Hinata, once freed, takes back Hanabi's eyes. Toneri tries to make one final attack and Naruto and Hinata prepare to face him together, but Toneri is knocked into space by thestatue. Naruto saves him and Toneri gives up, allowing Hinata to tell him Hamura's true wishes: to protect the Earth, not to destroy it. Toneri is repentant and remains behind when they head home, vowing not to let the Moon endanger the Earth again. As they return through the same passage they used before, Hinata asks Naruto about the scarf he's been wearing. He tells her it was a gift from hismother, causing her embarrassment that she would be jealous. Upon hearing Naruto say that he wants to spend the rest of his life with her, Hinata sheds tears of joy. As the passageway disintegrates behind them, Naruto propels himself and Hinata back to the Earth, where they share their first kiss.

She also wears a pair of lavender slippers. Years later, Hinata has let her hair grow long again, and ties it in a ponytail now. She also dons an outfit that consists of a long-sleeved, collared white shirt, lavender dress, and blue pants. Hinata was born on December 27 and is the first daughter of Hiashi, who is the leader of the clan, and his unnamed wife. She has a younger sister named Hanabi and a cousin namedNeji. Hinata is described as a weakling in the clan because of her sweet and gentle nature in which her father fears that she is not fit to be the next heir to the clan and that her sister who is only about five years younger can surpass her. Hinata does her very best to become strong and she trains very hard to impress her father. Hinata has both feelings and admiration for Naruto who gives her the confidence to work very hard. She was later taken in byKurenai Y\\u016bhiwho became her sensei, and she later became part of the Rookie 9. During the Chunin Exams, she fought against her cousin Neji with Naruto cheering her on and giving her the courage to never back down, even though she was severely wounded. She is now on good terms with her clan, especially with Neji, who has become her protector, and later watched Naruto depart with Jiraiya on his two-year training so that he can get Sasuke back after he, the retrieval team, Rock Lee, and the three sand siblings previously failed due to the interference of Kimimaro. Hinata Hyuga (Shippuden) In Part II, Hinata is 16 years old and is now a full-level Chunin. When Naruto came back home for the first time after his journey, Hinata blushed and fainted. Hinata was assigned with her team along with Team Kakashi to look for Sasuke. Hinata along with Naruto and Yamato split up together until they were confronted by Kabuto Yakushi who gave them a book that had records and all the information about the Akatsuki members. Before Kabuto left, Hinata used her Byakugan and noticed that 33 percent of Kabuto's body is being covered with Orochimaru's flesh. Later, Hinata met up with her team and they encountered Tobi who delayed their search. Hinata used her Byakugan to help guide her team in finding Tobi. After hearing the news thatSasukedefeatedItachi, Tobi disappeared and Hinata used her Byakugan to help her team follow him. Hinata discovered that there were black flames (Amaterasu) burning where Sasuke and Itachi had their final battle, and the team rushed to investigate only to find that Tobi got there before they did and took Sasuke with him. Later, Pain invaded Konoha and Hinata helped tend to the citizens to escape the wreckage and heal the wounded. Hinata witnessed Naruto fighting Pain with her Byakugan and noticed that Naruto was starting to lose to Pain and was pinned down by him. Despite Naruto's orders not to get involved in his battle, Hinata rushed to Naruto's aid to defend Naruto. Naruto asked her why she was throwing her life away and she told him that she was doing it because she loved him, which shocked Naruto. In the manga, Hinata used herTwin Lion Fiststo attack Pain, but Pain simply dodged the attack, threw her down, and used his Chakra Sensor Rod and stab her. In the anime, she was able to hit the Deva Path with herTwin Lion Fistsand Pain used hisShinra Tenseito subdue her, but Hinata was able to stand up and continue to fight. She was able to crawl over to Naruto and remove the Chakra sensor Rod from Naruto's hand. While her nindo way was echoing in Naruto's head, Naruto watched as Pain stabbed Hinata. In both of these versions, it caused Naruto to snap and release the Eight-TailedKuramawhile the weakened Hinata watched on. Hinata was taken away from the team with Sakura healing her. Later, a relieved Hinata celebrated with the villagers on Naruto's victory of defeating Nagato and she smiled softly as the worried Sakura hugged and thanked Naruto. to be added to be added Originally, Hinata was considered weak due to her gentle personality which hindered her performance which deemed her unworthy for her role as the clan heiress. After committing herself to training to become stronger for Naruto, she received praise from her team and her clan for improving her skills and strengthening character. Two years after the war, Hinata was recognized byHamura \\u014ctsutsukias the Byakugan Princess proved to be crucial in the destruction of the Tenseigan, although she could not destroy it herself. Despite spending at least, a decade as a housewife she was able to survive an attempt to get Naruto back fromMomoshiki \\u014ctsutsukiand defeat Hanabi who is an active j\\u014dnin and continues training to become the next clan leader, in a sparring match. Hinata at the time was reluctant to fight and unprepared when Hanabi was attacking seriously. Despite being rusty, she was able to keep up and win against Hanabi. From special clan training, Hinata has very advanced chakra control. Hinata did additional training and expanded on it during Part I; one product of this training was to make Water Needles by forming her chakra around her from nearby water sources and be used as a projectile. By Part II of the anime, Hinata's control has advanced enough to match a medical-nin. which was the reason she was assigned to help perform the Four-Corner Sealing Barrier. When meeting Hamura, she inherited some of his charka because she is a member of the main house of the Hy\\u016bga clan. Its strength and purity of her chakra attractsToneri \\u014ctsutsuki. Because she is a member of the main house of the Hy\\u016bga clan and a direct bloodline from Hamura she could come into contact and find the Tenseigan. Though she could not destroy it herself, she instead held Naruto's hand to give him allowance to touch the Tenseigan and for him to destroy it, since anyone who does not have the bloodline of a Hy\\u016bga and \\u014ctsutsuki cannot touch it. As a Hy\\u016bga, Hinata possesses the Byakugan, which grants her penetrative vision in a near-360\\u00b0 around herself, with a blind spot at the back of the neck above the first thoracic vertebra. With it, she is able to assist others frequently in tracking, and scouting the area for their target(s); by focusing her vision on a single direction, Hinata can see across distances, reaching as far as 20 kilometers by the battle against Toneri. Hinata's Byakugan grants her attacks with pinpoint accuracies, which she can share with others to also improve their own. She can also use it in order to identify genjutsu, searching for the caster in the nearby area. In the anime, she can use infrared vision and magnify it to see tiny targets. By adulthood, the chakra sensitivity provided by the Byakugan allows her to pick up on the slightest presence of chakra.

When drawn in a more serious style, Saitama is revealed to have sharp facial features, fearsome eyes, and chiseled musculature. His posture changes as well, with a slack posture and sloping shoulders when lax, and a straightened posture and squared shoulders when serious. Saitama's hero costumeconsists of a yellow one-piece jumpsuit with a short zipper at the collar and a black belt with a round golden buckle at its center. He wears red gloves that go 3/4 up his forearms and red boots that nearly reach his knees. His costume is finished with a white cape, fastened to his shoulders with big, round buttons. Saitama owns several shirts and hoodies with various designs. This includes his: Saitama's character on the upper surface can be best summed up as \\\"average\\\". At first glance, nothing about him strikes anyone he meets or causes them to note anything remarkable about him. Before becoming a hero, he was an average salaryman and did not seem interested in anything initially, though becoming a hero has always been a dream of Saitama's.[27]Before becoming one, he used to be frustrated about society, just likeHammerheadand even commenting that he could have become just like them depending on the path he took.[28] Due to his great power and being virtually indestructible, Saitama is an indifferent person. Even the mightiest foes pose no challenge to him, so he does not take his hero work seriously, goes through everything with little to no effort, and yearns for an opponent that can provide him with a challenge.[29]The lack of worthy opponents has led him to suffer from a self-imposed existential crisis,[7]and he claims that his ability to feel any emotions has dulled considerably.[30]The combination of his attitude, unstoppable power, and \\\"unimpressive\\\" appearance often causes his battles to become anticlimactic. Saitama will usually allow his opponents to rant about their motives and power up into their strongest forms, before obliterating them with a single punch.[31] Saitama's indifferent expression after knowing people speaking ill of him Saitama's indifference doesn't rest solely on his hero work either. In daily life, he is often seen lounging around, playing video games, reading manga, or going out for strolls. His taste in food is rather plain, and he often frequents food stalls rather than going to restaurants or cooking at home. As his primary interest, hero work has become unfulfilling, and he pays little attention to anything else. A running gag about Saitama is his inability to remember people's faces and names, as seen when he forgotSpeed-o'-Sound Sonic's name,[32]or when he could not remember whoTanktop Tigerwas.[33]Because of this, he sometimes ends up pronouncing people's names incorrectly, much to their chagrin.[34]Saitama does not care if people insult him, and he usually ignores them and says that they need a hobby;[35]the only insult that could get a reaction out of him is anything about his lack of hair.[36][37]He has expressed distaste towards his officially assigned hero name, Caped Baldy. Thus, even after receiving it, he always refers to himself as Saitama. Saitama's reaction knowing he will miss a bargain sale Despite his indifference, Saitama can find things that interest him and actively looks for activities to relieve his boredom. These things tend to be mundane activities such as watching TV, shopping, or playing games. He shows a measure of concern when it comes to bargains and deals, as seen when he foughtCarnage Kabuto, where he was more shocked upon the realization that he was going to miss a bargain sale, rather than his opponent, who had undergone atransformationand was beating him around.[38] Saitama gets impatient with Genos' explanation He can also express irritation and even outright anger depending on the situation. However, Saitama has limited patience for long explanations and often interrupts the speaker.[39][40][41]His ideal word count is 20 or less.[39]He can get angry when he loses to someone like King when they play games. He will become enraged if anyone messes with his food or damages his home as he immediately killed a mantis monster for crashing through his roof and told Genos to move his fight with Sonic somewhere away from his apartment. Aside from being quite a cheapskate due to his financial status, he has a greedy side seen when he tried to steal bags of gold from the underground mine inside theMonster Association Headquartersand was visibly upset after accidentally dropping them down to the bottom of an underground ravine.[42] Despite his general indifference to most things, Saitama was genuinely shocked when he realized that no one knew of him despite his achievements, curious as to why he doesn't have any fans. This reaction demonstrates that while he isn't necessarily into hero work for fame, he certainly doesn't object to it.[43]Another running joke is Saitama's jealousy of higher rankings, such as when he grew irritated whenGenoslisted off all of the comments made by fans about how amazing Genos is in their eyes. Beneath the surface, Saitama is much more complex than his appearance and attitude suggest. While he scored low on the written portion of the hero exam, he is, by no means, unintelligent. Saitama is very observant, insightful, and has high tactical awareness. This is seen in how he could easily discern situations and character traits from the people and environment around him. He could pick up several hints about Sonic's persona upon their first meeting.[44]When two tank top heroes jealously plotted to ruin him after themeteor event, he remarked that there were irate and self-serving hero types like them. He was even able to discernFubuki's forced offer of submission or destruction just before his crackdown on how the hero world really works than how it is currently run.[45]Saitama has shown remorse to his enemies before, particularly those who can give him a stimulating fight and don't just go down in one hit. One such example of this isBoros, the self-claimed \\\"Dominator of the Universe\\\", with whom Saitama sympathized due to suffering from similar circumstances, though, in the end, even Boros still could not draw out Saitama's full power.[46] Saitama tends to come off as abrasive to others and often is inconsiderate of their feelings or how his words affect them. That isn't to say he is intentionally malicious or rude, but rather that his indifference extends to his social interactions. He reacted to Fubuki greeting him as the number 1 B-Class heroine with a quick acknowledgement but seemed otherwise unimpressed frustrating Fubuki. He also downplays the gravity of situations based on his own perspective rather than that of others, never considering that those without his earth-shattering power would be rightly more horrified in extreme cases like Boros threatening to destroy the world or the monster society declaring open war on humanity. During his fight with Garou, Saitama initially displayed his unconcerned attitude against the Human Monster, from playful banter to compliments on Garou's capability. Saitama turning the civilians against him Despite his aloof, carefree, and uninterested personality, Saitama is actually one of the most morally upright heroes in the story. While many other heroes only care about personal achievements so they can rank up in order to gain more fame and popularity, Saitama is very humble, as he purposefully let the masses turn against him in order for the defeated heroes to be given credit for their efforts against theDeep Sea King, even claiming that they had weakened the monster before his arrival wanting to give credit to the heroes that were actually risking their lives to protect innocent people.[47]Saitama did the same for thepolice station, killing a monster while disguised as apolice officer, despite potentially gaining much fame had he revealed who he actually was as he heard the Hero Association executive try to force the police to beg for assistance exclaiming that, \\\"Police and heroes don't help people because someone had to beg\\\".[48]This is also his outlook on being a hero as he told Genos, \\\"If heroes run and hide, who will stand and fight\\\". He also did not mind thatKingtook credit for all of his achievements.[49]One of the most understated signs of Saitama's high morality is that he never uses his incredible strength for evil, even though no one can stop him from doing whatever he wants. Saitama telling Genos he's gotten stronger Although he may initially rub people the wrong way and seldom shows his emotions to others, it doesn't mean Saitama doesn't show care for the people around him or their physical or mental well-being. On some occasions, he's helped people with their mental issues, such as a suicidal man wanting to jump off a building,[50]and giving words of encouragement to Fubuki about how she should not seek the approval of others but live her life how she wanted.[51]He promisedTareoto stop Garou without killing him,[52]and complemented Genos after the cyborg saved Tatsumaki by claiming that his heart had grown stronger.[53] While he has no problem killing monsters, Saitama has yet to be seen killing anotherhumanand only ever uses enough strength to knock them out. His restraint is so ingrained that no matter the opponent's power and no matter how much Saitama knows about them, he only kills when he intends to kill, even if he hits someone unexpectedly, such as the number of times he's knocked out Garou. Saitama exhibiting a somber demeanor following Genos' death in the Ominous Future In theOminous Future, after the devastating deaths of Genos and numerous other heroes at the hands of Garou, Saitama becomes despondent. He begins questioning his abilities and intuition as a hero, lamenting that he tends to arrive too late to prevent such tragic outcomes. Quickly, this changes into a state of tranquil anger, where he decides to no longer hold back against Garou. The death of Genos also causes Saitama to lose any potential excitement at facing the Hero Hunter, despite considering Garou a strong opponent who may provide him with a challenging fight, showing his depression at his disciple's end.[54]In spite of his anger towards Garou for his cruel doings, at the end of their fight, Saitama recalls his promise to Tareo about not killing Garou (or he has always kept it in mind during the fight). He eventually calms down and reverts to his casual, relaxed demeanor, complying with the Hero Hunter's request to teach him a time travel technique. Garou later comments that individuals of such immense power as himself and Saitama require the presence of others to act as anchors, to help them maintain their sanity - the sense of isolation that accompanies such unparalleled strength can be enough to drive even the most powerful beings to the brink of madness.[55] Saitama motivates Glasses to become stronger Saitama has proven to be a good figure to other people, both heroes and villains alike. His influence made Genos quit his revenge wishes and start focusing on training to become a good and strong hero.[56][57]He has also made insecure people like Fubuki andGlassesstand up to their challenges and become better heroes.[58]Saitama also advises King to train and become strong for real, rather than being upset the latter stole credit from his battles.[59] As Genos notes, Saitama \\\"attracts the strong\\\", as many powerful heroes and villains have taken a liking to him.[60]This is due to his lack of interest in hero ranking and fame that attracts them.[61] Saitama is the titularOne-Punch Manand the strongest character in the series. So far, no enemy has been able to injure him in any way, and almost no enemy has been able to survive a single earnest punch from him. A few enemies havesurvivedpunches from him, such as any human he has struck (whom he restrains himself against) and Boros, whom Saitama empathized with and held back against so as to give himself and Boros a satisfying and stimulating fight. His strength is so great that it vastly eclipses even artificial beings designed or bred specifically for superhuman combat, such asmechanical beingsor the mutated warriors from theHouse of Evolution. Since no enemies have posed any real challenge to Saitama yet, the upper bound of his strength is likely even higher than it currently appears. The only opponent (so far) who has actually made him put visible effort into defeating was Garou, whose powers and abilities were enhanced by \\\"God\\\", and that's mostly due to the former's ability to copy Saitama's strength so as to fight him as an equal. While his power is only limited to heightened human traits (he cannot fly or fire energy blasts), his superhuman abilities are more than enough to compensate for the lack of variety in his powers. The origin of Saitama's immense strength is mysterious and unclear. Although he tells everyone he got his incredible power through mere physical training, no one believes him at all.[63]According to Saitama, after a year and a half of 100 daily push-ups, sit-ups, and squats, plus 10 km daily running, he had achieved some level of superhuman strength.[63]This training was apparently so intense for Saitama that he at times felt he might die, and claims that it is what caused all of his hair to suddenly and eventually fall out.[63]Genos believes that Saitama himself does not actually know or understand how he gained his power, and hopes to learn the secret by sparring with and observing him,[64]whileDr. Genusbelieves that Saitama worked out with said training regimen so hard that he had removed hislimiter.[65]It should be noted that Saitama would complete all parts of the training one after the other without breaks and was battling monsters that appeared during that time, which would have made completing the training more intense than it would normally be expected. Genos beating Saitama in an eating contest Despite his unbelievable physical prowess, Saitama can be outperformed by people with skills in areas outside fighting, like when he was bested byBangin a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors or defeated byKingin video games, mostly in one-sided matches.[66][67]Furthermore, he also seems to possess a normal human appetite, as he lost to Genos in a spicy noodle eating contest.[68] Saitama displays overwhelming strength in his punches Unparalleled Strength: Saitama possesses seemingly limitless physical strength and is capable of effortlessly defeating powerful monsters and villains with a single, casual punch (although this strength is not limited to punches). His punches are so powerful that many monsters simply explode when struck. An example of this casual yet overwhelming offensive power occurs when Saitama launches himself from the top of a building, blasts right through a giantmeteorwith a punch, lands safely, and calmly decides to go home.[69]Another instance is when Sonic tries to attack Saitama with a sword; he stops the sword by catching it with his teeth, effortlessly shattering the blade with the power of his jaw.[70]When launched fromEarthto the moon by Boros, he used his jumping power to return to Earth in mere moments, causing a huge shockwave and leaving a massive crater on the surface of the moon upon departure.[71]A \\\"normal\\\" punch from him was shown to be highly destructive, even to someone as durable as Boros.[72]A \\\"serious\\\" punch from him was able to counter the latter's strongest attack,Collapsing Star Roaring Cannon, an attack capable of destroying the planet or its surface. Not only did Saitama completely negate Boros' final attack using his serious punch, but the shockwave from the punch was also powerful enough to part clouds on a global scale.[73]When fightingOrochi, the high-speed pressure of the lava fired from his hands was enough to overpower and completely disperse Orochi'sGaia Cannon, an incredibly powerful attack that drew energy from the Earth's core and caused worldwide earthquakes.[74]Additionally, he is capable of destroying the Earth if he wanted to,[75]and has threatened to do so when irritated.[76]His strength has been stated by numerous characters to defy reason.[77][78][79] Saitama dispersing Jupiter's gases with a sneeze With only one hand, Saitama could lift the entire surface ofIo, a moon ofJupiter, launching its wreckage intospace.[80]In his fight againstCosmic Fear ModeGarou, whose copying powers allowed him to wield Saitama's strength himself, a collision between twoSerious Punches from them produced aSerious Punch\\u00b2that resulted in immensely powerful waves of energy able to destroy the Earth. After being diverted by Blast and his allies, the compressed energy from the collision further travelled into outer space before exploding and presumably destroying numerousstar systemsin the far distance, leaving a massive hole of starless-darkness in the cosmos.[81]In the climax of the fight against Garou on Io, Saitama was able to accidentally blow away half the gas of Jupiter, the largest planet in the solar system, with aSerious Sneeze.[82] Saitama jumps off the moon Saitama dodging Genos's attack Unparalleled Speed and Reflexes: Saitama possesses unparalleled speed and reflexes. He was able to complete a 1500-meter dash in an instant during his hero tryouts.[88]He has proven able to effortlessly outpaceSpeed-o'-Sound Sonic, a ninja whose specialty is his superspeed.[89][90]Even Genos's computerized targeting systems have difficulty tracking him.[91]He once ran down a building to save a piece of salmon he was having for lunch, and leap back up said building without bystanders noticing he had even done so.[50]His speed is so impressive that he can outpaceFlashy Flash, an S-Class hero well-known for his extraordinary speed, easily dodging and catching his sword swings.[92]When kicked to the moon by Boros, he quickly made a jump back to Earth, demonstrating the ability to travel at high-speeds.[93]In addition, he was capable of easily reacting to and blocking rocks thrown at near-lightspeed byGeryuganshoop,[94]the speed of which being like a bad joke to him.[95] Saitama travelling across a moon at incredibly high speeds In hisfightagainst evolved monster Garou, Saitama proved himself firmly superior to and able to effortlessly keep up with him, despite the Hero Hunter previously being capable of creating a giant light structure alongsidePlatinum Spermin only 1.3 milliseconds (0.0013 seconds) through sheer speed.[96][97][98]On Io, one ofJupiter's moons, after flipping a large amount of ground into the air with hisSerious Table Flip, he was capable of covering immensely huge distances by dashing across tons of rubble, having jumped around the natural satellite so fast that a large constellation was created from his sheer speed.[99]Ironically, despite his incomparable reflexes and speed, he still has problems squashing a simple mosquito.[100] During a training day when he still had hair, Saitama attempted to quickly turn his head to see the back of it in a mirror. Although he failed at first, in the end, he supposedly managed to glimpse the back of his head.[101]It is likely that achieving this would require him to move his head at a speed approaching that of light, along with having reflexes and reaction times as quick, ensuring that the reflected image in the mirror would not have enough time to change significantly before his eyes could perceive it, so to speak. Saitama creating countless afterimages Superhuman Stamina and Endurance: After becoming too powerful from his training regimen, Saitama has no longer been shown to tire out when fighting enemies. The only time he was shown to be panting and out of breath from continuous running, he recovered just seconds later.[110]He could still suppress pain even before gaining his overwhelming power.[111][112]This has been shown on numerous occasions dating back to his days as a middle school student, taking a beating from two upper-level students and, laterPiggy Bancon, a Wolf-level threat. Saitama then got back up when the bullies could not and chased after the pig-like monster for his money.[113]Other similar feats include enduring strikes fromCrablanteandPersonification Of A Light Pull Cordduring his training as an adult among others. Superhuman Eyesight: Saitama's eyesight is superhuman; after being kicked to the Moon by Boros, he could see, pinpoint the location of thegiant spaceship, and land back on it from the lunar distance.[93]His tracking capability is also astonishing, as he can concentrate on a fast-moving object for a long time and still not lose sight of it, as seen when he was the only person to see where Garou escaped to.[114][115]He is also able to see in the dark, as he was able to spot a kid a great distance away during the night.[116] Invulnerability: Saitama possesses unparalleled toughness and durability, being able to withstand attacks from even the most powerfulMysterious Beingswithout the slightest damage.[117]In fact, no character has actually been able to damage, or even physically harm Saitama in any way. When Genos created a huge, spherical blast of flame to killMosquito Girl's mosquitoes, Saitama remained standing right next to him completely unharmed (though his clothes were burnt).[118]Another testament to his astonishing durability is that Garou, who, despite having gained enormous strength from monsterization, still could not inflict even the slightest damage on Saitama during their fight.[96][97]Notably, he was capable of withstanding Garou'sExtreme Fa Jin, an attack powerful enough to raise a large landmass on the other side of the planet, without any injury.[98]When facing a Garou who became influenced by \\\"God\\\", a mysterious entity possessing frightening supernatural powers, Saitama sustained multiple nuclear explosions generated by the Hero Hunter point-blank without any physical harm.[119]Even after taking Garou's Gamma Ray Burst head-on, narratively described as the same phenomenon as agamma ray burst, the most powerful type of explosion known in the universe, he emerged unscathed.[120]Despite Garou utilizing hisMode: Saitama, a supernatural mimicry ability, to harness Saitama's striking power and hit him with it, he could still withstand the assault without noticeable damage.[121] Saitama prefers to dodge or block attacks using edged weapons,[122][123]rather than take them head-on, as he sometimes does with strikes from fists or blunt objects. However,Nyan's powerful claws, which can cut buildings into pieces, were shown unable to affect Saitama's head, indicating his remarkable resistance to piercing damage as well.[124]Additionally, Garou'sWhirlwind Iron Cutting Fistcould only destroy Saitama's clothing without cutting the skin underneath.[125]When being shot by machine guns from Bofoi's highly advanced robots, the bullets bounced harmlessly off his skin. Saitama submerging in lava with no problem Saitama holding his breath on the moon with no difficulty Vacuum Adaptation: Saitama has remarkable control over his breath, demonstrated by his ability to effortlessly hold it even in outer space. He managed to jump from the Moon back to Earth in seconds without showing any signs of suffocation,[131]despite the lack of atmosphere and increased radiation exposure.[132]His body has been shown to adapt to and withstand extraterrestrial environments where oxygen is scarce or absent. For instance, during his battle with Garou on Io, one of Jupiter's moons, he showed no adverse effects from the thin and unbreathable atmosphere there.[133]These feats, along with his exceptional resistance to cosmic radiation and superhuman endurance, suggest that Saitama has the capability to endure the harsh environmental conditions ofouter spaceas well, at least for a decent period of time. Accelerated Development: After almost a year of following his training regimen, Saitama realized that his body had adapted to move with the prowess befitting a true hero that he imagined.[112]As a consequence, his power started to skyrocket at a rapid pace. In a short period, he achieved unparalleled levels of physical abilities, a testament to his extraordinary growth rate. In his fight with Garou onIo, Saitama's growth rate began to soar exponentially due to the intense emotions coursing through him.[121] Saitama enters Phoenix Space, a spiritual space Non-Physical Interaction: Saitama was capable of separating his consciousness from his body to intrude on thePhoenix Space, a mental space that only exists withinPhoenix Man's bird costume, and breaking a hole into it, much to the latter's confusion.[134]Before entering, he could somehow sense thatChild Emperorand Phoenix Man were having a conversation inside the aforementioned spiritual space, and he mistakenly thought that they were talking about his head. After leaving the Phoenix Space, Saitama's consciousness simply returned to his physical body in the same way as Child Emperor's and Phoenix Man's did.[135] Mimicry: Saitama possesses the remarkable ability to learn and replicate other techniques just by witnessing them once. Similarly to Garou, he can not only copy techniques, but also improve upon them. The sheer extent that this mimicry prowess displays is remarkably exceptional, as he was even able to copy Garou's ability to travel through time.[121] Saitama traveling through time Master Hand-to-Hand Combatant: Thanks to many fights with monsters and villains during his training, Saitama has gained a fair amount of fighting experience. Due to his immeasurable power and the resulting boredom, he usually does not focus on technique and relies on basic attacks. Unlikemartial artists, his fighting style is simple but solid, bolstered by his absolute strength. Garou comments that Saitama is an amateur fighter and has many openings to exploit. However, in hisfightagainst Garou onIo, it becomes evident that he is an exceptionally quick learner, capable of mastering any martial arts techniques after observing them only once. Nevertheless, at the end of the day, he chooses to remain a brawler, favoring simple but powerful punches over martial arts. For him, the simplicity of being a brawler is more appealing than mastering complex techniques, as his raw power and speed are more than sufficient to overwhelm his opponents. Saitama also uses karate chops,[138]and grappling moves to take down villains he doesn't want to kill, or just to knock out people who pick on him. Improvisation: Saitama is very proficient with improvised weapons, such as when he killed hisfirst monsterby deftly using his tie to grab the monster's eye and tear out his intestines. He is proficient at improvising in general; whenever he can't solve a fight with a punch or directly can't punch his foe, he always comes up with a solution in one way or another and uses unique moves supported by his immeasurable power. Some of these instances are with hisSerious Table Flip,[139][140]and hisSerious Headbutt.[141] Supernatural Accuracy: Saitama seems to have almost perfect precision since whenever he focuses on a target, he always strikes it. He can turn a rock into a deadly projectile that hits its target, as shown when he killed Geryuganshoop. He also had no trouble landing directly on Boros's ship from the moon, even though the angle to return to Earth was extremely small, leaving little room for error. Normal Series: Saitama's Normal Series consists of techniques in which he puts very little effort into attacking. Even though his attacks are loose in this style, most opponents tend to be finished off easily due to Saitama's tremendous strength and speed. Saitama usingConsecutive Normal Punches Killer Move: Serious Series(\\u5fc5\\u6bba\\u30de\\u30b8\\u30b7\\u30ea\\u30fc\\u30ba,Hissatsu Majishir\\u012bzu): In Serious Series, Saitama puts more effort into his attacks. His face looks more serious when he performs these \\\"serious\\\" attacks. Despite the incredible strength behind them, Saitama does not actually consider these moves to be anything special.[147] Saitama usingSerious Punch Saitama usingOmnidirectional Serious Punch Saitama performsSerious Table Flip Keen Perception: Saitama has an uncanny ability to see through a person's facade and understand their deepest motivations for acting the way they do. He repeatedly proves this by reading people like Fubuki andGlasses. In a similar vein, he learns of King's deception quickly but opts to keep it to himself. Nonetheless, he excels at it only when he takes it seriously. He is also the first person to recognize Garou's inner turmoil and the fact that the Hero Hunter was always hoping to be a hero and not a monster.[citation\\u00a0needed] Power Control: Despite his overwhelming and immeasurable physical strength, Saitama has shown to have control over it. He can regulate the energy output of his punches, determining the exact amount of power he wants to exert. This control allows him to minimize collateral damage to the environment. In spite of being capable of effortlessly obliterating powerful Dragon-level Mysterious Beings,[62]and parting clouds across the entireplanetwith his punches,[93]Saitama can still deliver strikes with just enough force to incapacitate weaker opponents, such as humans or criminals, without causing severe or life-threatening injuries to them.[161] Saitama shattering Sonic's sword using his jaw Strong Teeth: In one of his fights with Sonic, the latter attacks him with a sword, which the Caped Baldy replies via biting and destroying said sword with no effort.[70] Strong Farts: In hisfightwith Garou, after getting a stomachache and being sent flying away, Saitama let out a strong fart that the propulsion from said flatulence gave him enough momentum to soon catch up to the Hero Hunter.[162] Intimidation: Even though he does not look scary at first glance, those aware of Saitama's power are afraid of him. Sonic and Genos were left amazed and frightened by Saitama's ability to emit a \\\"powerful aura,\\\" which made his opponents tremble and feel under pressure. When confronted by someone Saitama dislikes or finds annoying, all he has to do is threaten them with a few choice words, and they will cower in fear. Indomitable Will: Saitama has been shown to possess incredible willpower. It is most evident in the flashback to his hero training regime. Even if he was in great pain, or could barely move, or vomited blood, he continued his training.[163]Through sheer willpower and effort, Saitama removed his naturallimiterand became an invincible hero. In the original webcomic, Saitama's willpower is also evident in his fight with Tatsumaki. His strength of will is directly connected to his psychic resistance. Tatsumaki, the strongest knownesperin the universe, was unable to bend Saitama or lift him into space, exclaiming for the latter that he was \\\"too heavy\\\", although this was while she was injured.[130] Surfing Skills: Saitama has displayed the ability to balance an entireaircraft carrierand keep it stable as he surfs it down a gargantuan wave.[164] Saitama's rating determined by theHero Association[4]: Saitama's rating determined byGenos[165]:\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Personality\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Due to his great power and being virtually indestructible, Saitama is an indifferent person. Even the mightiest foes pose no challenge to him, so he does not take his hero work seriously, goes through everything with little to no effort, and yearns for an opponent that can provide him with a challenge.[29]The lack of worthy opponents has led him to suffer from a self-imposed existential crisis,[7]and he claims that his ability to feel any emotions has dulled considerably.[30]The combination of his attitude, unstoppable power, and \\\"unimpressive\\\" appearance often causes his battles to become anticlimactic. Saitama will usually allow his opponents to rant about their motives and power up into their strongest forms, before obliterating them with a single punch.[31] Saitama's indifferent expression after knowing people speaking ill of him Saitama's indifference doesn't rest solely on his hero work either. In daily life, he is often seen lounging around, playing video games, reading manga, or going out for strolls. His taste in food is rather plain, and he often frequents food stalls rather than going to restaurants or cooking at home. As his primary interest, hero work has become unfulfilling, and he pays little attention to anything else. A running gag about Saitama is his inability to remember people's faces and names, as seen when he forgotSpeed-o'-Sound Sonic's name,[32]or when he could not remember whoTanktop Tigerwas.[33]Because of this, he sometimes ends up pronouncing people's names incorrectly, much to their chagrin.[34]Saitama does not care if people insult him, and he usually ignores them and says that they need a hobby;[35]the only insult that could get a reaction out of him is anything about his lack of hair.[36][37]He has expressed distaste towards his officially assigned hero name, Caped Baldy. Thus, even after receiving it, he always refers to himself as Saitama. Saitama's reaction knowing he will miss a bargain sale Despite his indifference, Saitama can find things that interest him and actively looks for activities to relieve his boredom. These things tend to be mundane activities such as watching TV, shopping, or playing games. He shows a measure of concern when it comes to bargains and deals, as seen when he foughtCarnage Kabuto, where he was more shocked upon the realization that he was going to miss a bargain sale, rather than his opponent, who had undergone atransformationand was beating him around.[38] Saitama gets impatient with Genos' explanation He can also express irritation and even outright anger depending on the situation. However, Saitama has limited patience for long explanations and often interrupts the speaker.[39][40][41]His ideal word count is 20 or less.[39]He can get angry when he loses to someone like King when they play games. He will become enraged if anyone messes with his food or damages his home as he immediately killed a mantis monster for crashing through his roof and told Genos to move his fight with Sonic somewhere away from his apartment. Aside from being quite a cheapskate due to his financial status, he has a greedy side seen when he tried to steal bags of gold from the underground mine inside theMonster Association Headquartersand was visibly upset after accidentally dropping them down to the bottom of an underground ravine.[42] Despite his general indifference to most things, Saitama was genuinely shocked when he realized that no one knew of him despite his achievements, curious as to why he doesn't have any fans. This reaction demonstrates that while he isn't necessarily into hero work for fame, he certainly doesn't object to it.[43]Another running joke is Saitama's jealousy of higher rankings, such as when he grew irritated whenGenoslisted off all of the comments made by fans about how amazing Genos is in their eyes. Beneath the surface, Saitama is much more complex than his appearance and attitude suggest. While he scored low on the written portion of the hero exam, he is, by no means, unintelligent. Saitama is very observant, insightful, and has high tactical awareness. This is seen in how he could easily discern situations and character traits from the people and environment around him. He could pick up several hints about Sonic's persona upon their first meeting.[44]When two tank top heroes jealously plotted to ruin him after themeteor event, he remarked that there were irate and self-serving hero types like them. He was even able to discernFubuki's forced offer of submission or destruction just before his crackdown on how the hero world really works than how it is currently run.[45]Saitama has shown remorse to his enemies before, particularly those who can give him a stimulating fight and don't just go down in one hit. One such example of this isBoros, the self-claimed \\\"Dominator of the Universe\\\", with whom Saitama sympathized due to suffering from similar circumstances, though, in the end, even Boros still could not draw out Saitama's full power.[46] Saitama tends to come off as abrasive to others and often is inconsiderate of their feelings or how his words affect them. That isn't to say he is intentionally malicious or rude, but rather that his indifference extends to his social interactions. He reacted to Fubuki greeting him as the number 1 B-Class heroine with a quick acknowledgement but seemed otherwise unimpressed frustrating Fubuki. He also downplays the gravity of situations based on his own perspective rather than that of others, never considering that those without his earth-shattering power would be rightly more horrified in extreme cases like Boros threatening to destroy the world or the monster society declaring open war on humanity. During his fight with Garou, Saitama initially displayed his unconcerned attitude against the Human Monster, from playful banter to compliments on Garou's capability. Saitama turning the civilians against him Despite his aloof, carefree, and uninterested personality, Saitama is actually one of the most morally upright heroes in the story. While many other heroes only care about personal achievements so they can rank up in order to gain more fame and popularity, Saitama is very humble, as he purposefully let the masses turn against him in order for the defeated heroes to be given credit for their efforts against theDeep Sea King, even claiming that they had weakened the monster before his arrival wanting to give credit to the heroes that were actually risking their lives to protect innocent people.[47]Saitama did the same for thepolice station, killing a monster while disguised as apolice officer, despite potentially gaining much fame had he revealed who he actually was as he heard the Hero Association executive try to force the police to beg for assistance exclaiming that, \\\"Police and heroes don't help people because someone had to beg\\\".[48]This is also his outlook on being a hero as he told Genos, \\\"If heroes run and hide, who will stand and fight\\\". He also did not mind thatKingtook credit for all of his achievements.[49]One of the most understated signs of Saitama's high morality is that he never uses his incredible strength for evil, even though no one can stop him from doing whatever he wants. Saitama telling Genos he's gotten stronger Although he may initially rub people the wrong way and seldom shows his emotions to others, it doesn't mean Saitama doesn't show care for the people around him or their physical or mental well-being. On some occasions, he's helped people with their mental issues, such as a suicidal man wanting to jump off a building,[50]and giving words of encouragement to Fubuki about how she should not seek the approval of others but live her life how she wanted.[51]He promisedTareoto stop Garou without killing him,[52]and complemented Genos after the cyborg saved Tatsumaki by claiming that his heart had grown stronger.[53] While he has no problem killing monsters, Saitama has yet to be seen killing anotherhumanand only ever uses enough strength to knock them out. His restraint is so ingrained that no matter the opponent's power and no matter how much Saitama knows about them, he only kills when he intends to kill, even if he hits someone unexpectedly, such as the number of times he's knocked out Garou. Saitama exhibiting a somber demeanor following Genos' death in the Ominous Future In theOminous Future, after the devastating deaths of Genos and numerous other heroes at the hands of Garou, Saitama becomes despondent. He begins questioning his abilities and intuition as a hero, lamenting that he tends to arrive too late to prevent such tragic outcomes. Quickly, this changes into a state of tranquil anger, where he decides to no longer hold back against Garou. The death of Genos also causes Saitama to lose any potential excitement at facing the Hero Hunter, despite considering Garou a strong opponent who may provide him with a challenging fight, showing his depression at his disciple's end.[54]In spite of his anger towards Garou for his cruel doings, at the end of their fight, Saitama recalls his promise to Tareo about not killing Garou (or he has always kept it in mind during the fight). He eventually calms down and reverts to his casual, relaxed demeanor, complying with the Hero Hunter's request to teach him a time travel technique. Garou later comments that individuals of such immense power as himself and Saitama require the presence of others to act as anchors, to help them maintain their sanity - the sense of isolation that accompanies such unparalleled strength can be enough to drive even the most powerful beings to the brink of madness.[55] Saitama motivates Glasses to become stronger Saitama has proven to be a good figure to other people, both heroes and villains alike. His influence made Genos quit his revenge wishes and start focusing on training to become a good and strong hero.[56][57]He has also made insecure people like Fubuki andGlassesstand up to their challenges and become better heroes.[58]Saitama also advises King to train and become strong for real, rather than being upset the latter stole credit from his battles.[59] As Genos notes, Saitama \\\"attracts the strong\\\", as many powerful heroes and villains have taken a liking to him.[60]This is due to his lack of interest in hero ranking and fame that attracts them.[61] Saitama is the titularOne-Punch Manand the strongest character in the series. So far, no enemy has been able to injure him in any way, and almost no enemy has been able to survive a single earnest punch from him. A few enemies havesurvivedpunches from him, such as any human he has struck (whom he restrains himself against) and Boros, whom Saitama empathized with and held back against so as to give himself and Boros a satisfying and stimulating fight.

His punches are so powerful that many monsters simply explode when struck. An example of this casual yet overwhelming offensive power occurs when Saitama launches himself from the top of a building, blasts right through a giantmeteorwith a punch, lands safely, and calmly decides to go home.[69]Another instance is when Sonic tries to attack Saitama with a sword; he stops the sword by catching it with his teeth, effortlessly shattering the blade with the power of his jaw.[70]When launched fromEarthto the moon by Boros, he used his jumping power to return to Earth in mere moments, causing a huge shockwave and leaving a massive crater on the surface of the moon upon departure.[71]A \\\"normal\\\" punch from him was shown to be highly destructive, even to someone as durable as Boros.[72]A \\\"serious\\\" punch from him was able to counter the latter's strongest attack,Collapsing Star Roaring Cannon, an attack capable of destroying the planet or its surface. Not only did Saitama completely negate Boros' final attack using his serious punch, but the shockwave from the punch was also powerful enough to part clouds on a global scale.[73]When fightingOrochi, the high-speed pressure of the lava fired from his hands was enough to overpower and completely disperse Orochi'sGaia Cannon, an incredibly powerful attack that drew energy from the Earth's core and caused worldwide earthquakes.[74]Additionally, he is capable of destroying the Earth if he wanted to,[75]and has threatened to do so when irritated.[76]His strength has been stated by numerous characters to defy reason.[77][78][79] Saitama dispersing Jupiter's gases with a sneeze With only one hand, Saitama could lift the entire surface ofIo, a moon ofJupiter, launching its wreckage intospace.[80]In his fight againstCosmic Fear ModeGarou, whose copying powers allowed him to wield Saitama's strength himself, a collision between twoSerious Punches from them produced aSerious Punch\\u00b2that resulted in immensely powerful waves of energy able to destroy the Earth. After being diverted by Blast and his allies, the compressed energy from the collision further travelled into outer space before exploding and presumably destroying numerousstar systemsin the far distance, leaving a massive hole of starless-darkness in the cosmos.[81]In the climax of the fight against Garou on Io, Saitama was able to accidentally blow away half the gas of Jupiter, the largest planet in the solar system, with aSerious Sneeze.[82] Saitama jumps off the moon Saitama dodging Genos's attack Unparalleled Speed and Reflexes: Saitama possesses unparalleled speed and reflexes. He was able to complete a 1500-meter dash in an instant during his hero tryouts.[88]He has proven able to effortlessly outpaceSpeed-o'-Sound Sonic, a ninja whose specialty is his superspeed.[89][90]Even Genos's computerized targeting systems have difficulty tracking him.[91]He once ran down a building to save a piece of salmon he was having for lunch, and leap back up said building without bystanders noticing he had even done so.[50]His speed is so impressive that he can outpaceFlashy Flash, an S-Class hero well-known for his extraordinary speed, easily dodging and catching his sword swings.[92]When kicked to the moon by Boros, he quickly made a jump back to Earth, demonstrating the ability to travel at high-speeds.[93]In addition, he was capable of easily reacting to and blocking rocks thrown at near-lightspeed byGeryuganshoop,[94]the speed of which being like a bad joke to him.[95] Saitama travelling across a moon at incredibly high speeds In hisfightagainst evolved monster Garou, Saitama proved himself firmly superior to and able to effortlessly keep up with him, despite the Hero Hunter previously being capable of creating a giant light structure alongsidePlatinum Spermin only 1.3 milliseconds (0.0013 seconds) through sheer speed.[96][97][98]On Io, one ofJupiter's moons, after flipping a large amount of ground into the air with hisSerious Table Flip, he was capable of covering immensely huge distances by dashing across tons of rubble, having jumped around the natural satellite so fast that a large constellation was created from his sheer speed.[99]Ironically, despite his incomparable reflexes and speed, he still has problems squashing a simple mosquito.[100] During a training day when he still had hair, Saitama attempted to quickly turn his head to see the back of it in a mirror. Although he failed at first, in the end, he supposedly managed to glimpse the back of his head.[101]It is likely that achieving this would require him to move his head at a speed approaching that of light, along with having reflexes and reaction times as quick, ensuring that the reflected image in the mirror would not have enough time to change significantly before his eyes could perceive it, so to speak. Saitama creating countless afterimages Superhuman Stamina and Endurance: After becoming too powerful from his training regimen, Saitama has no longer been shown to tire out when fighting enemies. The only time he was shown to be panting and out of breath from continuous running, he recovered just seconds later.[110]He could still suppress pain even before gaining his overwhelming power.[111][112]This has been shown on numerous occasions dating back to his days as a middle school student, taking a beating from two upper-level students and, laterPiggy Bancon, a Wolf-level threat. Saitama then got back up when the bullies could not and chased after the pig-like monster for his money.[113]Other similar feats include enduring strikes fromCrablanteandPersonification Of A Light Pull Cordduring his training as an adult among others. Superhuman Eyesight: Saitama's eyesight is superhuman; after being kicked to the Moon by Boros, he could see, pinpoint the location of thegiant spaceship, and land back on it from the lunar distance.[93]His tracking capability is also astonishing, as he can concentrate on a fast-moving object for a long time and still not lose sight of it, as seen when he was the only person to see where Garou escaped to.[114][115]He is also able to see in the dark, as he was able to spot a kid a great distance away during the night.[116] Invulnerability: Saitama possesses unparalleled toughness and durability, being able to withstand attacks from even the most powerfulMysterious Beingswithout the slightest damage.[117]In fact, no character has actually been able to damage, or even physically harm Saitama in any way. When Genos created a huge, spherical blast of flame to killMosquito Girl's mosquitoes, Saitama remained standing right next to him completely unharmed (though his clothes were burnt).[118]Another testament to his astonishing durability is that Garou, who, despite having gained enormous strength from monsterization, still could not inflict even the slightest damage on Saitama during their fight.[96][97]Notably, he was capable of withstanding Garou'sExtreme Fa Jin, an attack powerful enough to raise a large landmass on the other side of the planet, without any injury.[98]When facing a Garou who became influenced by \\\"God\\\", a mysterious entity possessing frightening supernatural powers, Saitama sustained multiple nuclear explosions generated by the Hero Hunter point-blank without any physical harm.[119]Even after taking Garou's Gamma Ray Burst head-on, narratively described as the same phenomenon as agamma ray burst, the most powerful type of explosion known in the universe, he emerged unscathed.[120]Despite Garou utilizing hisMode: Saitama, a supernatural mimicry ability, to harness Saitama's striking power and hit him with it, he could still withstand the assault without noticeable damage.[121] Saitama prefers to dodge or block attacks using edged weapons,[122][123]rather than take them head-on, as he sometimes does with strikes from fists or blunt objects. However,Nyan's powerful claws, which can cut buildings into pieces, were shown unable to affect Saitama's head, indicating his remarkable resistance to piercing damage as well.[124]Additionally, Garou'sWhirlwind Iron Cutting Fistcould only destroy Saitama's clothing without cutting the skin underneath.[125]When being shot by machine guns from Bofoi's highly advanced robots, the bullets bounced harmlessly off his skin. Saitama submerging in lava with no problem Saitama holding his breath on the moon with no difficulty Vacuum Adaptation: Saitama has remarkable control over his breath, demonstrated by his ability to effortlessly hold it even in outer space. He managed to jump from the Moon back to Earth in seconds without showing any signs of suffocation,[131]despite the lack of atmosphere and increased radiation exposure.[132]His body has been shown to adapt to and withstand extraterrestrial environments where oxygen is scarce or absent. For instance, during his battle with Garou on Io, one of Jupiter's moons, he showed no adverse effects from the thin and unbreathable atmosphere there.[133]These feats, along with his exceptional resistance to cosmic radiation and superhuman endurance, suggest that Saitama has the capability to endure the harsh environmental conditions ofouter spaceas well, at least for a decent period of time. Accelerated Development: After almost a year of following his training regimen, Saitama realized that his body had adapted to move with the prowess befitting a true hero that he imagined.[112]As a consequence, his power started to skyrocket at a rapid pace. In a short period, he achieved unparalleled levels of physical abilities, a testament to his extraordinary growth rate. In his fight with Garou onIo, Saitama's growth rate began to soar exponentially due to the intense emotions coursing through him.[121] Saitama enters Phoenix Space, a spiritual space Non-Physical Interaction: Saitama was capable of separating his consciousness from his body to intrude on thePhoenix Space, a mental space that only exists withinPhoenix Man's bird costume, and breaking a hole into it, much to the latter's confusion.[134]Before entering, he could somehow sense thatChild Emperorand Phoenix Man were having a conversation inside the aforementioned spiritual space, and he mistakenly thought that they were talking about his head. After leaving the Phoenix Space, Saitama's consciousness simply returned to his physical body in the same way as Child Emperor's and Phoenix Man's did.[135] Mimicry: Saitama possesses the remarkable ability to learn and replicate other techniques just by witnessing them once. Similarly to Garou, he can not only copy techniques, but also improve upon them. The sheer extent that this mimicry prowess displays is remarkably exceptional, as he was even able to copy Garou's ability to travel through time.[121] Saitama traveling through time Master Hand-to-Hand Combatant: Thanks to many fights with monsters and villains during his training, Saitama has gained a fair amount of fighting experience. Due to his immeasurable power and the resulting boredom, he usually does not focus on technique and relies on basic attacks. Unlikemartial artists, his fighting style is simple but solid, bolstered by his absolute strength. Garou comments that Saitama is an amateur fighter and has many openings to exploit. However, in hisfightagainst Garou onIo, it becomes evident that he is an exceptionally quick learner, capable of mastering any martial arts techniques after observing them only once. Nevertheless, at the end of the day, he chooses to remain a brawler, favoring simple but powerful punches over martial arts. For him, the simplicity of being a brawler is more appealing than mastering complex techniques, as his raw power and speed are more than sufficient to overwhelm his opponents. Saitama also uses karate chops,[138]and grappling moves to take down villains he doesn't want to kill, or just to knock out people who pick on him. Improvisation: Saitama is very proficient with improvised weapons, such as when he killed hisfirst monsterby deftly using his tie to grab the monster's eye and tear out his intestines. He is proficient at improvising in general; whenever he can't solve a fight with a punch or directly can't punch his foe, he always comes up with a solution in one way or another and uses unique moves supported by his immeasurable power. Some of these instances are with hisSerious Table Flip,[139][140]and hisSerious Headbutt.[141] Supernatural Accuracy: Saitama seems to have almost perfect precision since whenever he focuses on a target, he always strikes it. He can turn a rock into a deadly projectile that hits its target, as shown when he killed Geryuganshoop. He also had no trouble landing directly on Boros's ship from the moon, even though the angle to return to Earth was extremely small, leaving little room for error. Normal Series: Saitama's Normal Series consists of techniques in which he puts very little effort into attacking. Even though his attacks are loose in this style, most opponents tend to be finished off easily due to Saitama's tremendous strength and speed. Saitama usingConsecutive Normal Punches Killer Move: Serious Series(\\u5fc5\\u6bba\\u30de\\u30b8\\u30b7\\u30ea\\u30fc\\u30ba,Hissatsu Majishir\\u012bzu): In Serious Series, Saitama puts more effort into his attacks. His face looks more serious when he performs these \\\"serious\\\" attacks. Despite the incredible strength behind them, Saitama does not actually consider these moves to be anything special.[147] Saitama usingSerious Punch Saitama usingOmnidirectional Serious Punch Saitama performsSerious Table Flip Keen Perception: Saitama has an uncanny ability to see through a person's facade and understand their deepest motivations for acting the way they do. He repeatedly proves this by reading people like Fubuki andGlasses. In a similar vein, he learns of King's deception quickly but opts to keep it to himself. Nonetheless, he excels at it only when he takes it seriously. He is also the first person to recognize Garou's inner turmoil and the fact that the Hero Hunter was always hoping to be a hero and not a monster.[citation\\u00a0needed] Power Control: Despite his overwhelming and immeasurable physical strength, Saitama has shown to have control over it. He can regulate the energy output of his punches, determining the exact amount of power he wants to exert. This control allows him to minimize collateral damage to the environment. In spite of being capable of effortlessly obliterating powerful Dragon-level Mysterious Beings,[62]and parting clouds across the entireplanetwith his punches,[93]Saitama can still deliver strikes with just enough force to incapacitate weaker opponents, such as humans or criminals, without causing severe or life-threatening injuries to them.[161] Saitama shattering Sonic's sword using his jaw Strong Teeth: In one of his fights with Sonic, the latter attacks him with a sword, which the Caped Baldy replies via biting and destroying said sword with no effort.[70] Strong Farts: In hisfightwith Garou, after getting a stomachache and being sent flying away, Saitama let out a strong fart that the propulsion from said flatulence gave him enough momentum to soon catch up to the Hero Hunter.[162] Intimidation: Even though he does not look scary at first glance, those aware of Saitama's power are afraid of him. Sonic and Genos were left amazed and frightened by Saitama's ability to emit a \\\"powerful aura,\\\" which made his opponents tremble and feel under pressure. When confronted by someone Saitama dislikes or finds annoying, all he has to do is threaten them with a few choice words, and they will cower in fear. Indomitable Will: Saitama has been shown to possess incredible willpower. It is most evident in the flashback to his hero training regime. Even if he was in great pain, or could barely move, or vomited blood, he continued his training.[163]Through sheer willpower and effort, Saitama removed his naturallimiterand became an invincible hero. In the original webcomic, Saitama's willpower is also evident in his fight with Tatsumaki. His strength of will is directly connected to his psychic resistance. Tatsumaki, the strongest knownesperin the universe, was unable to bend Saitama or lift him into space, exclaiming for the latter that he was \\\"too heavy\\\", although this was while she was injured.[130] Surfing Skills: Saitama has displayed the ability to balance an entireaircraft carrierand keep it stable as he surfs it down a gargantuan wave.[164] Saitama's rating determined by theHero Association[4]: Saitama's rating determined byGenos[165]:\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Abilities and Powers\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The origin of Saitama's immense strength is mysterious and unclear. Although he tells everyone he got his incredible power through mere physical training, no one believes him at all.[63]According to Saitama, after a year and a half of 100 daily push-ups, sit-ups, and squats, plus 10 km daily running, he had achieved some level of superhuman strength.[63]This training was apparently so intense for Saitama that he at times felt he might die, and claims that it is what caused all of his hair to suddenly and eventually fall out.[63]Genos believes that Saitama himself does not actually know or understand how he gained his power, and hopes to learn the secret by sparring with and observing him,[64]whileDr. Genusbelieves that Saitama worked out with said training regimen so hard that he had removed hislimiter.[65]It should be noted that Saitama would complete all parts of the training one after the other without breaks and was battling monsters that appeared during that time, which would have made completing the training more intense than it would normally be expected. Genos beating Saitama in an eating contest Despite his unbelievable physical prowess, Saitama can be outperformed by people with skills in areas outside fighting, like when he was bested byBangin a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors or defeated byKingin video games, mostly in one-sided matches.[66][67]Furthermore, he also seems to possess a normal human appetite, as he lost to Genos in a spicy noodle eating contest.[68] Saitama displays overwhelming strength in his punches Unparalleled Strength: Saitama possesses seemingly limitless physical strength and is capable of effortlessly defeating powerful monsters and villains with a single, casual punch (although this strength is not limited to punches).
