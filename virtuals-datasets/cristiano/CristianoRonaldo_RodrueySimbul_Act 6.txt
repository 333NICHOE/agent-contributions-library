1. Well, for me, it's a pleasure to be with you
2. When I started to play football, I mean, when I was very, very young with
3. Probably seven, eight, nine years old, I started to play at home, in the street, with my colleagues, with my friends
4. And I think this is where everything starts
5. You know, that you start to feel that the sport is fun
6. I think so, yes
7. I thought it was like the first love when I started to
8. to play in the streets, it was fun
9. And I said, listen, I like this
10. I will be false if I say yes
11. In the beginning, when you start, you always have that passion
12. to enjoy yourself, to spend time with friends, and to have fun
13. But in the beginning, not even with 14, 15, 16 years old, I didn't feel that
14. Maybe after that, with 18, 19, 20s, yes, I start to feel everything was different
15. In the beginning, probably it was my father
16. My father, in the beginning, pushed me a lot
17. Not a lot, a little bit
18. To follow my dream
19. In the beginning, with seven, eight years, it was my father
20. Because he saw that I had some talent, and he kept pushing me to play, not only in the street
21. We had a local team in Madeira that they call Andorinha
22. I don't know how you say it in English
23. Andorinha, I don't know how you say that word
24. I don't know how you say it, but now they're going to think, is it a club
25. Madeira club, that everyone knows
26. I will tell you in English, it's the name of the bird
27. And I started to be with teammates and I started, you know, the rule of football
28. I start that there
29. To be honest, I think both have to work in the same time because
30. Talent without work is nothing, and work without talent is nothing too
31. So I think they both mix up
32. And of course I have two
33. I'm not to say that I have more one than the other one, because if you see my whole career for the last 20 years
34. my level was high
35. And this is, as you can know, it's really tough
36. Not only in football, but in any area
37. If you are top for 20 years, it's unbelievable
38. And I do that, and I continue to do that
39. For me, it's a big achievement
40. And my biggest motivation is to carry on, to still enjoy, to make people happy, to make my family happy
41. So for me, I have both talent and work ethic
42. Maybe both, my mom too
43. Mom and dad, my brothers too
44. I think it's this childhood to make you feel what you are or make you be what you are
45. The difficult of things that you pass through in your life
46. make you be stronger mentally to challenge a hard life
47. And of course, the environment too helps
48. I don't know if you know, but I moved with 11 years old from Madeira
49. to Lisbon, which is hard, to be honest
50. It probably was the most difficult part in terms of professional of my career, so it was hard to leave my family in Madeira, to follow my dream in Lisbon, without your family, with 11 years old
51. I can see now my kids, Cristiano and my oldest son
52. I don't know if I will be capable to let him go to, I don't know
53. In this age, two years more
54. Will be tough
55. Life is a box of surprises and it's hard, you know
56. It's not easy, you know, to be
57. in this level and still push and still motivate to carry on, to score goals, to be in a good shape, to compete with the young Lions
58. They're coming and when they play against me, they want to show me that they are stronger than me and faster than me
59. You have to prepare very well
60. In terms of physically, but mentally too, I think it's very hard
61. But in the same way, it's a challenge, you know, because as you can see, if you treat your body well, you can maintain it for many, many years
62. And this is the big challenge for me
63. And it's great
64. I feel proud for that
65. To have this age and still compete at the highest level, for me it's
66. It's great and give me motivation to carry on
67. I discovered Whoop a few years ago
68. And to be honest, for me, it's a tool that can help me
69. It's like to have a doctor in your wrist
70. And for me, I cannot live without Whoop because it's helped me a lot, not only in terms of physically, but mentally and in a sleep way
71. It's a great tool in my opinion
72. So I'm really pleased that I use it
73. It's like in the beginning, I've fallen in love since I started to use it
74. So I feel good with that
75. Well, I can be cookie and say, I give you the map
76. You are willing to do that
77. It's the main point, because everyone wants to be Cristiano
78. I give you the map
79. You think you will do it that
80. It's the discipline
81. The discipline is the most difficult thing, not only in the sports, but in the life
82. I think it's all package
83. Helps you to maintain
84. a good nutrition, in my opinion
85. It's all components, not only these components, but you have a few more that helps you to be good, in my opinion
86. So, small details in the end of the day will make the big difference, in my opinion
87. So, as you say, and I will keep repeating, the consistency is the most difficult thing
88. Just doing it every day
89. Yes, every day
90. I fight against my mind
91. Yes, sometimes it happens
92. We are all human beings
93. We are not happy every day
94. We are not in a good mood every day
95. It's part of us
96. What do you do to overcome that
97. I fight against that
98. It's the big challenge
99. It's when you're not willing to do something, but you have to do it
100. This is the main point
101. This is why I say
102. Our mind is a box of surprises and you have to challenge yourself to be consistent
103. I repeat, sometimes it's hard
104. It's what many people say, you like to go to the gym every day
105. Of course not
106. It's not true
107. Nobody likes to go to the gym every day
108. But you have to do it
109. Probably yes, because
110. your mental strength is coming from that, from that moment, that in a hard moment, you know you should do it
111. And I do it because after that, maybe in the beginning you feel hard to start, but after when you finish the gym or cold plunge or even the training, you will feel better
112. I think it's the big key there
113. For me, right now, it's a normal day in office, as you say sometimes
114. It's part of my life
115. It's like some people, they don't brush their teeth every day
116. They don't take a coffee every day
117. So, I take a cold punch every day because it's part of my routine, my journey
118. And it's not a sacrifice for me, to be honest
119. I enjoy doing that
120. Serious I'm not I'm not say that's just Surprising people
121. No, I mean joy to do it this kind of stuff probably for some persons that Sacrifice is a nightmare
122. But for me, no, I really enjoy to be honest because I felt after that I feel good
123. What's your routine like which order do you do things
124. We are animals of routines, you know and my routines it's I
125. 90% of my days, they are very similar
126. You know, you want to know since I wake up
127. Yeah, let's do it
128. So in the morning, I wake up, I have my cold plunge, I have my machines, I have my showers and everything
129. I wake up, I go there
130. First thing, I dive in
131. First thing in the cold
132. First thing, yes
133. I prepare my water to drink because, you know, as you know, during the night
134. With dehydration, it's very low, so I take my water, my shower, my cold plunge
135. I come down, you know, be nice with my
136. with my family, with my kids, I give a hug
137. I'm coming out to have lights in my eyes
138. Two, three minutes just to give the information to my brain that it's early
139. Time to wake up
140. And after that, I take my coffee and when I start
141. my day, a nice conversation
142. It's my routine, what I like to do it
143. It's like in the morning to sit, take my coffee, speak with my kids, with my wife and start the day
144. This is my routine after, of course
145. During the day, I have a thousand things to do, but this is the basic point
146. This is the
147. That gets you started
148. I don't do it every day
149. I do it, for example, the breath, I do it in meditation when I feel a little bit more stressful, especially the day of the game
150. Sometimes I do visualise a few points that can happen in a game
151. I like to do it
152. And sometimes it's my subconscious that does it by itself
153. But it's nice
154. You visualise a few things
155. Not even during the game, but during the period that you go to the stadium to warm up, you know, before the game, during the game
156. And it's fun
157. It's fun, to be honest, and I like to do it
158. Even sometimes I speak with my friends and I tell them
159. I said, listen, today in the game we're gonna have a penalty
160. I felt the day of the game that they're gonna give a penalty and something will happen in the game
161. So I go more prepared because if you visualize before, you will be more prepared for that moment
162. So it's fun
163. Breathing, because it makes you calm
164. When I do that, it makes my heart rate come down
165. Routine, because even in training I do it
166. I don't do it only in a game, I do it even in training
167. Because it's a habit
168. When you do so many things, one thing, you become a habit
169. So, this is what I try to do every time
170. Because I think, as I told you before, for me, it's a fantastic tool
171. It helped me a lot to be a better man, better person, better athlete
172. And you can see what you do during the day, during the night, so it's a fantastic tool
173. And of course, I know too that you, the company, they're going very well and the perspective for the future seems very bright
174. So this is good
175. And I really love the product
176. So it's easy, match up for me
177. And to meet people like you, good people, I know even better that my decisions were perfect
178. So I'm really glad for that and congratulations
179. for invent this tool, because it helps so many people
180. And one of these people, it's me
181. So thank you very much
