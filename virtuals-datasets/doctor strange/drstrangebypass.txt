Warning: contains possible spoilers for Doctor Strange #18!
Doctor Strange has entered a new era, as he crowns a new Sorcerer Supreme for Earth
There have been multiple Sorcerer Supremes in the Marvel Universe, and Doctor Strange currently holds the title
However, the events of Blood Hunt changed all of that, forcing Strange to abdicate the title in favor of Doctor Doom, and now fans see the fallout in a preview for Doctor Strange #18.
Marvel shared a first look at Doctor Strange #18, written by Jed MacKay and drawn by Pasqual Ferry, with AIPT
The preview opens with Doctor Strange laying in bed, ruminating on how, to help stop the vampire invasion, he stripped himself of the title of Sorcerer Supreme and gave it to Doctor Doom
Strange is beginning to see himself as a failure, noting that Doom was able to save the world, but he was not.
With this downgrade in power comes the need for greater caution–just as Baron Mordo attacks.
The mantle of Sorcerer Supreme has been passed down for generations, and Doctor Strange is perhaps the best known person to hold the title
Others, such as Doctor Voodoo, have also been Sorcerer Supreme, but the title seems to find its way back to Strange every time
During Blood Hunt, Doctor Strange travels to Latveria, which was weathering the vampire invasion, seeking Doctor Doom’s help
Doom agreed on one condition: Strange would make him Sorcerer Supreme
When Doom followed through on his word, Strange had no choice but to do the same, thus giving Doom the power he desired.
Doctor Doom has long sought to become Earth’s Sorcerer Supreme, and is a perpetual runner-up for the title
Now that he has obtained the position, the heroes will have to contend with a super-charged Doctor Doom
Marvel has already given fans a good idea of how this will play out: early next year, the publisher launches One World Under Doom
Exact details about this event have been kept under wraps, but advanced art shows Marvel’s heroes kneeling before Doctor Doom
Clearly, Doctor Doom has plans as the Sorcerer Supreme–and they are not good.
In a preview for Doctor Strange 15, the Sorcerer Supreme undergoes a dark evolution, making him the perfect weapon to destroy the Avengers.
While the Marvel Universe navigates a world with Doctor Doom as the Sorcerer Supreme, Doctor Strange must come to terms with what he has done
Not only has he handed Doctor Doom the keys to great power, but he must contend with his failure to stop the vampire invasion
MacKay and Ferry show this sense of self-doubt in the preview
If this self-loathing is allowed to continue, it could adversely affect Doctor Strange, and maybe even diminish his chances of taking the mantle of Sorcerer Supreme back from Doctor Doom.
