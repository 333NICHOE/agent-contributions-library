wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i013_d004015.wav|3|And try and I'm gonna try and be much more, uh, profound and insightful than I ever have been|153480|157495|4.005
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i014_d003665.wav|3|This is this is this is, uh, my chance where I realized that doing the interviewing is actually not|161965|165630|3.655
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i015_d007475.wav|3|So I thought to begin at the beginning, how involved were you in the casting process and how much do I have to thank you for?|171140|178615|7.465
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i016_d002170.wav|3|Um, but do you remember working with Chris or|178745|180915|2.16
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i020_d006010.wav|3|Um, originally, what had happened was that David Hayman, the producer, um, knew my dad because my dad had been a literary agent.|200310|206320|6.0
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i021_d002271.wav|3|Um, and my dad had worked with David's mum.|206790|209061|2.26
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i022_d002970.wav|3|And so David sort of asked my dad if I would audition.|209385|212355|2.96
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i023_d006280.wav|3|And the original deal was that we'd heard was going to be to do 6 films and it was gonna be done in America and it was all sort of, you|212345|218625|6.269
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i024_d005195.wav|3|Well well, you know, well, thank well, obviously, maybe that's why it changed because you probably put your foot down at some point or they just went, I won't agree to that.|220970|226165|5.184
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i025_d005996.wav|3|But, um, I'm not somebody who particularly believes in faith and destiny and all those things, but my parents do.|231035|237031|5.985
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i026_d004990.wav|3|And so the final straw was the fact that I was I went to the theater to see a production of Stones in His Pockets.|237160|242150|4.98
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i027_d005850.wav|3|And David Heyman and Steve Clovis, who adapted all but one of the books, um, happened to be sitting in the row in front.|242495|248345|5.84
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i028_d003053.wav|3|And I was I was sat there for the whole time thinking, why is that man keeping|249135|252188|3.042
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i029_d005245.wav|3|And my and I remember at the interval, my mum and my dad both looking kind of quite intense about something.|256940|262185|5.235
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i030_d005851.wav|3|But, you know, when as a kid you're aware that you're being purposely kept out of the loop, you know, for your own good kind of thing.|262235|268086|5.84
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i031_d005315.wav|3|And, uh, I remember we went up the stairs and out of the theater and then sort of hid behind a pillar.|268075|273390|5.305
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i032_d005705.wav|3|I seem to remember that it's some absurd notion that David Amors, the Globes are gonna chase after us, you know, rap back.|273440|279145|5.695
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i033_d005550.wav|3|And, um, then there was some debate as to whether we would go back in for the second half but I was really enjoying the day.|282895|288445|5.54
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i034_d008145.wav|3|And so we went back in and then the next day they kind of my mom and dad sort of went, oh well maybe maybe it is God sort of trying to tell us something, you know.|288895|297040|8.135
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i053_d008911.wav|3|Do you think that in a way, we've we've shot ourselves in the foot with things like that for then Emma's reveal in the 4th film when she comes down and says, and there is supposed to have been this transformation.|396474|405385|8.9
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i054_d002330.wav|3|And because we're all looking going, well, she was already a beautiful girl.|406080|408410|2.32
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i062_d009340.wav|3|But it was interesting you mentioned about that audition because I was given a copy of my audition where I was, um, there were I mean, it turns out because none neither me, Rupert, and Emma could remember this.|446040|455380|9.33
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i063_d002250.wav|3|And I could hear Chris Columbus's voice off camera.|461130|463380|2.24
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i064_d003791.wav|3|And I believe he called from the library now.|466534|470325|3.78
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i065_d002365.wav|3|And I just remembered, God, he was brilliant.|472775|475140|2.355
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i066_d002190.wav|3|He was amazing with us.|475750|477940|2.18
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i067_d004025.wav|3|Like, I don't think anybody else could have got the enthusiasm out of those out|477990|482015|4.015
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i071_d005025.wav|3|In America, they treat you first and foremost as a star and then as a child.|512720|517745|5.015
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i072_d003051.wav|3|Whereas, actually, you should be treated as a kid first and then an actor second.|517794|520845|3.04
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i074_d006225.wav|3|Not really because I hadn't I wasn't even then fully aware of the scale of the phenomena at all.|526180|532405|6.215
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i075_d004970.wav|3|Mean, I I had the first two read to me by my dad who incidentally did a great basilisk voice.|532475|537445|4.96
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i076_d005970.wav|3|My dad, uh, my, uh, I did actually, uh, suggest it to Chris Columbus, which my dad was completely mortified by.|542230|548200|5.96
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i077_d011155.wav|3|But, no, I was I was, um, no, I don't think I could have ever had any and even now, I don't actually think I have an understanding of how far it reaches because it is a case of not being able to see the wood for the trees.|548190|559345|11.145
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i078_d004410.wav|3|You know, it's it's I'm so much in the middle of it that I actually can't see how far out it stretches.|559430|563840|4.4
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i086_d003505.wav|3|I'd rather be in my aircraft hanging out outside Leavesden with the rest of the crow, you know.|607885|611390|3.495
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i089_d002250.wav|3|Because we because on Potter, it's a very insular world|624215|626465|2.24
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i090_d002955.wav|3|So that you just basically you know, you go into work every day.|627655|630610|2.945
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i091_d002270.wav|3|We are the only film at Leavesden.|632200|634470|2.26
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i092_d003090.wav|3|So normally, you'd have interaction between different crews and things because if you're home|634520|637610|3.08
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i093_d010555.wav|3|What was lovely for us was that from my point of view, and I speak for, I think, most of the set, in terms of your involvement, you you were around a lot at the beginning and early on and very, very involved.|644095|654650|10.545
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i094_d004175.wav|3|And then as you kind of saw that we weren't going massively off|654640|658815|4.165
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i105_d003915.wav|3|I mean, I do I do I do I do think that that that they kind of no.|724550|728465|3.905
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i106_d005850.wav|3|But I do I do sometimes think that, you know, if we did make a 6 hour Harry Potter film, there would be|729735|735585|5.84
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i109_d010525.wav|3|So is there anything talking about things, you know, being cut out and things is there anything that we've cut that you were once, you know, a couple of things maybe that you were upset about that you thought could have been?|744780|755305|10.515
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i110_d008895.wav|3|And is there anything that we put in that maybe weren't in the books that you thought, you know, because I always remember there was I remember something about Alfonso, um, and the Dementors.|755295|764190|8.885
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i130_d003710.wav|3|The contact lenses, there is a very small percentage of people apparently who have a very,|881230|884940|3.7
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i131_d006145.wav|3|But there was because also the other thing that we didn't think was a particularly good sign early on was that the the green eyes went down so badly.|896120|902265|6.135
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i132_d005870.wav|3|But then, um, but then off I came up in these terrible spots after about a week.|902255|908125|5.86
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i133_d004891.wav|3|Like, really and and I, you know, then in my teen years did get bad acne but I was 11 at the time.|908829|913720|4.88
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i134_d002061.wav|3|That that was great make up and and some videos that|916601|918662|2.05
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i137_d002170.wav|3|I think Rupert was the luckiest of the 3 of us.|930670|932840|2.16
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i138_d003370.wav|3|But but me and Emma, well, particularly myself, they've got very, very scotty.|934435|937805|3.36
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i139_d005845.wav|3|It was brilliant because we put the glasses on and eventually we realized that I was allergic to them.|940035|945880|5.835
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i140_d005770.wav|3|I was actually allergic to the Harry Potter glasses because I had these two rings of whiteheads and spots had come up around my eyes.|945930|951700|5.76
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i141_d003176.wav|3|It it took us about a week to realize that it was actually the glasses, but it did|951689|954865|3.165
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i143_d003531.wav|3|I I but I also like that that you sort of people selectively believe in omens.|959650|963181|3.52
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i145_d006650.wav|3|I remember, um, my first day was quite scary because I had I looked on the call sheet and it just said me, Emma, Rupert, and Robbie Coltrane.|968305|974955|6.64
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i146_d002090.wav|3|Because actually we were shooting the last scene of the film that burst.|974945|977035|2.08
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i149_d008030.wav|3|Um, while we're on the topic of the other actors, um, Alan Rickman and I my relationship with Alan since the 5th film has changed totally.|995170|1003200|8.02
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i150_d003630.wav|3|And, you know, want because on the 5th film, I found him very, very intimidating.|1003875|1007505|3.62
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i151_d002591.wav|3|Before before you sort of and then I went and did Equis.|1010515|1013106|2.58
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i152_d002650.wav|3|And then, um, we we went out for dinner afterwards.|1013510|1016160|2.64
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i153_d002671.wav|3|And suddenly, I found that Alan is actually hilarious.|1016149|1018820|2.66
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i154_d003856.wav|3|And really funny and self deprecating and kind of wonderful company.|1021269|1025125|3.845
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i155_d004457.wav|3|And, um, and and who also was so supportive of me whenever I was going on stage.|1025574|1030031|4.445
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i156_d005450.wav|3|At one point, he cut short his holiday in, uh, I think in Canada to come back early and see the show so he could talk to me about it.|1030020|1035470|5.44
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i157_d003611.wav|3|And, um, but how much did he know originally?|1040654|1044265|3.6
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i162_d002350.wav|3|Alan, are you really milking this now?|1078335|1080685|2.34
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i166_d003450.wav|3|They're all trying to get me to to get a bit pissy about stuff because they wouldn't go home early.|1100480|1103930|3.44
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i167_d003045.wav|3|I've still not gone into the gone into the crew pressures yet.|1103920|1106965|3.035
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i171_d004125.wav|3|It was the one night you came and saw Equus was also the one that somebody threw an owl at a stage.|1134570|1138695|4.113
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i173_d002570.wav|3|And then afterwards, I remember I turned around to you and said|1144285|1146855|2.56
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i174_d003550.wav|3|And you very cryptically turned to sort of paused for a moment.|1149740|1153290|3.54
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i175_d002575.wav|3|You get a death scene, which was sort of And|1154460|1157035|2.565
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i176_d002891.wav|3|At at that point I was kinda like, okay, I sort of vaguely have some idea what's going on.|1161424|1164315|2.88
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i178_d006410.wav|3|But so when because I remember hearing a story at one point about, you know, you killing off a character and becoming very upset about it.|1176995|1183405|6.4
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i179_d004636.wav|3|And would you not be able to talk to him about that kind of stuff?|1183394|1188030|4.625
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i182_d002030.wav|3|You really were living with that wait 10.|1196505|1198535|2.02
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i185_d002730.wav|3|And also one of the coolest, most hardworking guys on|1210475|1213205|2.72
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i187_d002350.wav|3|But you can normally rely on me and Matt for understatement.|1225815|1228165|2.34
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i188_d007115.wav|3|In the books, obviously, it's how much was were your school days kind of influential on the kind of not not obviously in the magic,|1230935|1238050|7.105
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i189_d002570.wav|3|It's So all these kids you've inspired to go off to boarding school?|1241815|1244385|2.56
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i202_d012095.wav|3|Because in a way, one of the because what I like about Harry as a character is that one of the things that sort of marked him is that how so many of his relationships and so many of his most important moments in his life have been to do with death.|1341200|1353295|12.085
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i206_d007969.wav|3|As the books went on and you realized that actually, there were suddenly, it was getting a massive adult fan base as well.|1376296|1384265|7.959
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i207_d006316.wav|3|Did you then realize you could gear it more towards adults in showing that kind of stuff, or were you always gonna confront kids kind of with that?|1385034|1391350|6.305
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i216_d002170.wav|3|So coming on to Potter, how much then|1439820|1441990|2.16
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i217_d003016.wav|3|Because there's whole this it's almost become part of|1444060|1447076|3.005
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i218_d003210.wav|3|You knew all of it and that, like and and as these things do, they get out of hand.|1448585|1451795|3.2
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i219_d003905.wav|3|So the last chapter went from being written to being written to being in a safe with an armed guard.|1451785|1455690|3.895
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i225_d006535.wav|3|Because there's was there ever a chance that one of the main because I was convinced that one of the main 3 had to buy it eventually.|1500725|1507260|6.525
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i228_d002750.wav|3|I start thinking I might polish one of them off now.|1516865|1519615|2.74
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i240_d003690.wav|3|It's interesting that something like that image actually kept Hagrid safe.|1607210|1610900|3.68
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i255_d003450.wav|3|You know, to people watching this, there's there is very cynical way to watch this.|1696605|1700055|3.44
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i256_d002010.wav|3|The way we're talking about these characters as if they are real people.|1700045|1702055|2.0
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i257_d004705.wav|3|And people, I think, just need to understand that for you it's been pretty much 20 years with|1702045|1706750|4.695
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i258_d006396.wav|3|So it's you do get not just attached to the attitude, but the notion of them as the principles of those characters.|1710179|1716575|6.385
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i261_d008555.wav|3|Well, I was gonna ask about I do feel I have some duty on a on a personal level as well because I've always had my own suspicions about this.|1727100|1735655|8.545
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i262_d003216.wav|3|that would just tone out for the American press to get them stirred up a bit?|1743620|1746836|3.205
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i263_d002170.wav|3|It did, which is obviously very funny.|1747705|1749875|2.16
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i293_d010445.wav|3|It's interesting actually when you if you start to think for a moment, not about these characters being characters, but if you think about the characters the lives the characters actually have within the books.|1954115|1964560|10.435
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i294_d022305.wav|3|And the fact that to a certain level, because they exist in the collective consciousness of a generation, they do exist to a certain because I always think that's one of the wonderful things about Potter and the Potter fan base is that whereas if you think about the other big costume wearing and all that kind of stuff that goes with it, it's things like Star Wars and Star Trek.|1964950|1987255|22.295
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i295_d014092.wav|3|But what's interesting is that Potter, because it started off as a literary thing, has kind of created a generation of the same kind of mentality of geeky thoroughness, but with an appetite for reading and literature, which is kind of amazing.|1988124|2002216|14.08
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i297_d002051.wav|3|Be before the books even got picked up Yeah.|2021525|2023576|2.04
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i298_d002965.wav|3|Until, you know, sitting in this hotel room.|2023765|2026730|2.955
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i299_d004730.wav|3|What are some of the surreal kind of bizarre I mean, where do you start, I suppose?|2027620|2032350|4.72
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i300_d003185.wav|3|But for me, the the last premiere was mental.|2032340|2035525|3.175
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i303_d006025.wav|3|tumor and there was just these hundreds, this sort of tumult of people Yeah.|2059225|2065250|6.015
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i304_d002346.wav|3|Just surging forward like sort of and all drenched.|2065520|2067866|2.335
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i305_d003710.wav|3|been a moment when I could have absolutely just formed a dictatorship|2068815|2072525|3.7
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i306_d003776.wav|3|I could have just said, we'll march on the palace, and they all would have joined me at that point.|2073615|2077391|3.765
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i310_d002330.wav|3|I mean, um, the only thing you can do Yeah.|2106995|2109325|2.32
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i311_d002730.wav|3|Is laugh at it and it's hilarious and it's so funny.|2109395|2112125|2.72
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i312_d009727.wav|3|I mean, when somebody, I mean, tries to for instance, that we you know, when somebody once tried to jump into the front seat of the car with us does somebody try to follow us in afterwards?|2113409|2123136|9.715

wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i314_d005505.wav|3|You can either be terrified and think, oh, people are gonna try and get into my car, or you can think, that's hilarious that she tried to do that.|2125925|2131430|5.495
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i315_d003290.wav|3|I'm fine now that I'm safe and it's all fine and that was quite funny.|2131420|2134710|3.28

wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i321_d004226.wav|3|I've got a I've got a kind of, um, top top at least a top 4, I think, of these.|2165064|2169290|4.215
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i322_d003950.wav|3|That I was getting, uh, SAS guards to walk my dogs.|2172560|2176510|3.94

wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i324_d002410.wav|3|I mean, they're not featured, but they're just people know their names on the Internet.|2198255|2200665|2.4
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i325_d004830.wav|3|I was having for a while, I was having, uh, special brea Brea?|2206340|2211170|4.82
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i326_d006090.wav|3|Beer brewed in, uh, a monastery in Belgium by Belgian monks.|2211285|2217375|6.08
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i327_d006030.wav|3|There's one that I've grown, I think, about, um, 8 inches in about 6 weeks or something.|2223160|2229190|6.02
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i328_d002110.wav|3|Um, but my you know, that's not happened.|2232155|2234265|2.1
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i329_d012911.wav|3|Um, and, um, and the but the the one of my favorite ones was the rumor that, um, I was gonna be having a statue made of myself for my|2235354|2248265|12.9
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i330_d008795.wav|3|I think they obviously think I live sort of like some Roman emperor, like Caligula, just building statues to myself everywhere around you know, dotting them around the studio just as a response.|2249375|2258170|8.785
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i331_d002090.wav|3|He might just have himself encased in it and eat his way out.|2262000|2264090|2.08
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i332_d003285.wav|3|That's that's what actually, that would be quite a good I quite enjoy doing that.|2264080|2267365|3.275
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i333_d005310.wav|3|I was I will just, um, give you a quick list of the of what is the Grint Menagerie at the moment.|2267415|2272725|5.3
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i334_d002570.wav|3|Um, in terms of cars, I think he's got he's just sold He's|2273390|2275960|2.56
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i335_d006430.wav|3|And, uh, we had, uh, a bright orange Range Rover with blacked out windows.|2282775|2289205|6.42
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i336_d005690.wav|3|But he's and he's got, um, and he's now got, like, amazing pets, and he's got, like, llamas and peacocks and Llamas.|2294510|2300200|5.68
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i337_d008225.wav|3|Basically has done, you know, with his money what the rest of us would have done with our money when what we said we'd all do when we were 7, you know, and just have to have a really wonker house.|2300350|2308575|8.215
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i338_d002315.wav|3|We always make jokes about Rupert a lot because we all we always|2310645|2312960|2.305
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i339_d003930.wav|3|And we always say he gets out of bed, just into the water flume, down to the breakfast table.|2314770|2318700|3.92
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i340_d012657.wav|3|But, uh, as we were saying before before, um, one of my favorite moments, right, in a bizarre way because you know how when you sort of offend some people you know you must be doing something right.|2320864|2333521|12.645
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i341_d008675.wav|3|Well there was my favorite one of my favorite photos from Potter was, um, I think I think it made the cover of, like, The Times or some, you know, prop big proper newspaper.|2334450|2343125|8.665
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i342_d002110.wav|3|And it was a a huge bonfire|2343415|2345525|2.1
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i343_d007150.wav|3|And it was somebody throw was thrown a calendar and through the air, smiling was Rupert Grint's face being tossed into the flames.|2348070|2355220|7.14
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i344_d003770.wav|3|And it was one of the and it was and it was one of the abiding images that I've always remember.|2355525|2359295|3.76
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i345_d002236.wav|3|kind of dying from the fire.|2364085|2366321|2.225
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i346_d002490.wav|3|But, um, does that bother you, or do you think No.|2368210|2370700|2.48
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i349_d002650.wav|3|I I presume they're gonna have to buy copies to burn them so|2386910|2389560|2.64
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i355_d003936.wav|3|remember when I was 11, I was I was at, like, a party just, like, made|2421040|2424976|3.925
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i356_d005770.wav|3|Didn't go for me, but somebody like, the the mother of somebody who lived in our street, you you know, was saying, oh, I'm not sure.|2426325|2432095|5.76
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i357_d004965.wav|3|I'm not sure if kids would be able to tell the difference between black magic and it's magic.|2432085|2437050|4.955
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i365_d010645.wav|3|The opportunities that this has afforded me because people in interviews, the commonly asked question I get is people say, do you think it's gonna hold you back from, um, you know, doing other projects and things like that?|2489130|2499775|10.635
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i366_d004299.wav|3|Actually, the chances are I never would have become an actor if I hadn't got this opportunity to|2499765|2504064|4.289
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i369_d018915.wav|3|never would have got got the chance to do Equus or My Boy Jack or any of the other side and anything like and that's the thing I think that anybody whose career was born out of Potter has to remember that no matter what we do for the rest of our lives, it's the chances are it they are things where the opportunities we never would have had in the 1st place if we hadn't got Potter.|2516985|2535900|18.905
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i370_d011915.wav|3|And we were involved in this extraordinary thing for 10 years of filming that was kind of unlike anything else that's ever been done just in terms of the amount of people that are there and the continuity of of everybody being there.|2536050|2547965|11.905
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i374_d004650.wav|3|Uh, just recently we've all started thinking about it more, um, because you know what?|2563205|2567855|4.64
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i375_d008225.wav|3|It was a funny the the moment was actually, I was, um, um, talking to, um, Amanda Knight and Lisa Tomlin who do hair and makeup on Posse.|2567845|2576070|8.215
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i376_d005396.wav|3|Amanda's done my makeup every day for 10 years, um, and is an amazing makeup artist.|2576060|2581456|5.385
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i380_d002331.wav|3|So I was I was god, I was already giving you a drip at that stage.|2592429|2594760|2.32
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i381_d007727.wav|3|And, um, but I was talking to them the other day, and they were talking about, uh, another job that they might have lined up afterwards.|2596669|2604396|7.715
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i382_d004785.wav|3|And it was the first moment of actually it wasn't sadness and it wasn't, uh, it was jealousy.|2604445|2609230|4.775
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i383_d006306.wav|3|I was jealous that another actor was gonna get those 2 because Lisa's done my hair for the on the 6th and 7th film.|2609919|2616225|6.295
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i384_d002250.wav|3|Also, she was on the second, and she's been in and out.|2616215|2618465|2.24
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i385_d002830.wav|3|And so and someone I've come to know very, very well as well.|2618455|2621285|2.82
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i386_d003195.wav|3|Um, and so the fact that another actor is gonna get there I|2621495|2624690|3.185
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i387_d003291.wav|3|Is really sort of is something it's it's very peculiar.|2625479|2628770|3.28
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i388_d011315.wav|3|And, I mean, it's gonna be odd also because, you know, I've worked in a way with with the crew on Potter in such a way that I'm I actually feel much closer to the crew than I do to a lot of the cast.|2628760|2640075|11.305
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i391_d009025.wav|3|Because I've kind of worked out recently, particularly on this film, that that that if that success on a film set kind of relies upon the ability to concentrate very intensely for very short spaces of time.|2657040|2666065|9.015
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i392_d007525.wav|3|Um, and then you have to learn to switch off in the moments that you can because you can't keep yourself at that level of energy although I am quite hyper.|2669655|2677180|7.515
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i393_d005425.wav|3|You know, my mom and dad have often said to me they did get lucky when they got somebody with the kind of boundless energy that|2677310|2682735|5.415
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i395_d005115.wav|3|Because I remember the first day we met, I think, was when you came in and but all the kids were there.|2696000|2701115|5.105
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i401_d004170.wav|3|He's a bit older than the rest of us as well and he was when he was younger and had and had done a bit more work.|2728995|2733165|4.16
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i407_d007695.wav|3|The other person we should definitely talk about, because who I do think is sort of even though you notice what he does, he is the unsung hero of these films, Stuart Craig.|2756150|2763845|7.685
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i408_d002305.wav|3|Because it's the detail of everything.|2769835|2772140|2.295
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i409_d004111.wav|3|That's because that's because I think that's what has allowed us to survive as a successful franchise.|2772129|2776240|4.1
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i410_d005765.wav|3|And because, you know, because we sort of have because we started off at the same time as a whole host of other kids' fantasy films that sort of start.|2776610|2782375|5.755
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i411_d013155.wav|3|But the reason I think we've managed to do so well and sustain the the the story right to the end and keep people interested is largely down to, I think, the sets and the fact that the detail that goes into the world is so thorough.|2782365|2795520|13.145
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i415_d002010.wav|3|I think it maybe it's I don't think it's because it was everyone's favorite set.|2822670|2824680|2.0
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i417_d003070.wav|3|Well, we I mean, I've I've really I'm really eyeing up my glasses.|2832555|2835625|3.06
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i418_d005905.wav|3|See, the thing is, the wand for me is a less constant thing because it changed after the second film.|2840340|2846245|5.895
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i419_d005395.wav|3|And, um, because in Alfonso's words, he said that he thought the other wand looked too smooth and like it was from Ikea.|2848555|2853950|5.385
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i420_d005770.wav|3|Um, and so he gave me this sort of stick, you know, and, um, and which was which was great.|2854340|2860110|5.76
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i421_d005025.wav|3|But, um, um, all the chopping and changing with wands in the last book.|2860100|2865125|5.015
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i422_d005850.wav|3|and it's because we got and and and then try to explain it then to Rafe when Rafe comes on as Voldemort.|2876405|2882255|5.84
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i423_d009215.wav|3|And I'm kind of looking at him in his Voldemort makeup, and he's asking me about the ones that I'm completely panicking going, I've really got to find the most succinct way I can explain this to you in 2 minutes, but I don't know how that's possible.|2882245|2891460|9.205
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i424_d005165.wav|3|Because I remember I had to reread the end of 7 a few times.|2891450|2896615|5.155
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i426_d002090.wav|3|I like the epilogue, but some people had a problem with it.|2900765|2902855|2.08
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i437_d006170.wav|3|And going back to what was the moment like when you I I mean, how solid is the end of writing the book?|2973630|2979800|6.16
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i438_d002410.wav|3|I mean, do do you give it in and then it's done or do you Well, actually,|2979790|2982200|2.4
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i455_d003950.wav|3|It's gonna be it's gonna be very it's gonna be very strange and very upsetting.|3075895|3079845|3.94
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i456_d002170.wav|3|And but it's the little things that you'll miss most.|3080180|3082350|2.16
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i457_d012375.wav|3|But I mean and also it's the the fact that, you know, I mean, I'll I'll walk into that studio for one day over the next few months and sit down in front of that makeup mirror, and it'll be the last time that I film that day because then I'm going off and hopefully doing other things.|3082340|3094715|12.365
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i458_d004515.wav|3|And as you say, it will be liberating because I'll no longer have to, you know, when I get sent an amazing script, go, I'm sorry.|3094705|3099220|4.505
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i459_d009945.wav|3|But so I'm I'm very excited about the opportunity to just live that sort of actor's life and just getting a job and going off and doing it and, you know, and those kind of things, I'm I'm very excited about.|3102490|3112435|9.935
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i460_d006965.wav|3|But but it's also there's an awareness that it'll never be the same again, that I'll never have that period of time.|3112885|3119850|6.955
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i461_d007445.wav|3|And also, it's not just it's I mean, I look at this more, you know, in a in terms of a landmark, more than my 18th birthday was.|3119840|3127285|7.435
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i462_d002650.wav|3|This is that was me that is me leaving the nest now.|3128795|3131445|2.64
wavs/DG_Speaker_3_i463_d003435.wav|3|But, no, it's been, um, it's been a good 10 years for me, so thank you very much.|3131995|3135430|3.425
