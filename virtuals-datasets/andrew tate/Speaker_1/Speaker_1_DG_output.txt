wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i021_d004670.wav|1|I'm not saying I couldn't have and and enjoy the company of a single female for attorney.|127620|132290|4.66
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i022_d009885.wav|1|I'm saying my point is that, truthfully, if we remove all the garbage and the fairy tales, if men are true to their biology, no man is completely and utterly a one woman man.|132340|142225|9.875
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i023_d010576.wav|1|There's a societal expectation which has been placed upon humanity, and then we have a biological and evolutionary imperative, and the male evolutionary imperative is not to have 1 female.|143094|153670|10.565
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i024_d005850.wav|1|Now there are some dudes out there who are gonna disagree with me, but those are dudes, they got low testosterone, they're not a big g, they ain't got no money, they ain't nothing.|153905|159755|5.84
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i025_d008655.wav|1|But any man who's actually in a position of status since the dawn of human time, every single king, every single sultan, all of them had more than one chick.|161380|170035|8.645
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i026_d002170.wav|1|That's actually the natural human state.|170105|172275|2.16
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i027_d006190.wav|1|So the point I was trying to make is even though I am a man of God and I try and keep myself close to Christ.|172265|178455|6.18
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i028_d009616.wav|1|My point is any man who has the means to attract or solicit the company of more than 1 female likely will enjoy this the company of more than 1 female.|182510|192126|9.605
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i033_d002010.wav|1|Women want love and they want attention and those kind of things.|223545|225555|2.0
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i034_d012835.wav|1|And, yeah, I travel the world, but I really don't think that it's difficult to, uh, maintain a relationship purely based on if if if if the connection is true, then the physical presence doesn't have to be as prevalent.|225545|238380|12.825

wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i040_d002811.wav|1|I'm out here literally resisting the enslavement of man.|264305|267116|2.8
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i041_d004670.wav|1|I'm making money specifically so that I am, to a degree, at least, ungovernable.|270110|274780|4.66
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i042_d004605.wav|1|I mean, if I had a female, if I did, because of course I don't because I'm a man of god blah blah blah.|291350|295955|4.595
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i043_d004191.wav|1|If I had a female, she would have to be very understanding of the fact that I'm a man on a mission with a purpose.|295944|300135|4.18
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i044_d004411.wav|1|And, you know, some there are some missions she'll be allowed to come with me on and some missions she can't come.|300349|304760|4.4
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i045_d002190.wav|1|But, you know, but but otherwise, you gotta be careful.|312425|314615|2.18
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i046_d003345.wav|1|And I don't wanna look like a misogynist as usual.|315865|319210|3.335
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i048_d002991.wav|1|Like, if if you're a realist, then to some degree, you're gonna be a sexist.|334599|337590|2.98
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i050_d004170.wav|1|So I I personally, I don't like traveling the world with women.|346495|350665|4.16
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i051_d004276.wav|1|I think it's one of the most frustrating things a man can possibly do.|350655|354931|4.265
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i052_d003770.wav|1|Imagine you had to travel around the world, and you had to take a 3 year old with you.|355960|359730|3.76
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i053_d002275.wav|1|You'd You'd be like, and now you go, where's my 3 year old?|359720|361995|2.265
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i054_d002010.wav|1|With a chick, it's all, oh, I need food.|378125|380135|2.0
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i057_d014220.wav|1|Women have to be monitored and maintained and if if I'm gonna go Iraq, Afghanistan, all the places, I've not been to these places.|401325|415545|14.21
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i058_d002590.wav|1|We we start running like a chikalal will be standing there.|418555|421145|2.58
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i059_d007185.wav|1|I think that all men, in fact, I'd say the actual plague of Western nations today is that all men lack a natural masculine support network.|426860|434045|7.175
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i060_d004391.wav|1|I think it's the fact that most men out here don't have a genuine masculine support network.|435714|440105|4.38
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i061_d005390.wav|1|They don't have men around them that they can not so much confide in, but men hold other men accountable.|440095|445485|5.38
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i062_d003790.wav|1|It's very easy to be brave when every man you talk to is brave.|445635|449425|3.78
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i063_d002945.wav|1|And it's very hard to be brave if none of the men you speak to are brave.|449555|452500|2.935
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i064_d004650.wav|1|Well, then I'd have to get a masculine support network outside of Tristan, which I've already done and created myself.|454250|458900|4.64
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i065_d009705.wav|1|But, um, I don't think it would completely change who I am but, certainly, having my brother was important in my formative years because if somebody, like, didn't like me or something didn't like me, it didn't matter because me and my brother, we didn't care.|460245|469950|9.695
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i069_d003210.wav|1|And I left when I was 9, and I grew up on a council estate in Lewton.|497645|500855|3.2
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i071_d006575.wav|1|So I I left America when I was when I was around 9, and I lived in Luton until the age of 26 ish.|512615|519190|6.565
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i072_d003455.wav|1|My my fight gym was there, and I was fighting from there before I finally managed to get out.|522620|526075|3.445
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i073_d003530.wav|1|But I grew up in a council state in Luton, and I am so thankful for it.|526065|529595|3.52
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i074_d005065.wav|1|The best possible thing that can happen to somebody is to be born broke and become rich.|529585|534650|5.055
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i075_d002010.wav|1|If you're born broke and you stay broke, life's terrible.|536400|538410|2.0
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i076_d003130.wav|1|But to be born broke and become rich is a beautiful thing.|538400|541530|3.12
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i077_d004096.wav|1|Because truthfully, money really isn't all that interesting.|541520|545616|4.085
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i078_d003150.wav|1|What's interesting about money is stinging back to all the times you had no money.|545605|548755|3.14
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i079_d003679.wav|1|I love to go spend $25,000 for dinner, not because the money|548805|552484|3.668
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i081_d008245.wav|1|And the point is the food isn't worth it, and it's not worth 25 g's, but the whole fun of it is just thinking back to when you never had 25 grand in your life.|570530|578775|8.235
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i082_d002170.wav|1|So it's the juxtaposition that makes it interesting.|581650|583820|2.16
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i083_d004570.wav|1|So I love the fact that was those are some of the in some ways, they were some of the happiest times of my life.|585010|589580|4.56
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i084_d002831.wav|1|I'm not gonna say that being rich isn't fantastic because it certainly is.|593074|595905|2.82
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i085_d005136.wav|1|However, when you're broke, you have a very simple singular focus, which is what it should be just to make more money.|595954|601090|5.125
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i086_d003930.wav|1|But now my focus is more spread out because I really I really do not need to make more money.|601160|605090|3.92
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i091_d002430.wav|1|Well, the hardship my whole life was hardship.|625660|628090|2.42
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i092_d003930.wav|1|And and to some degree, I try and make sure my life retains some degree of hardship.|628235|632165|3.92
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i093_d003805.wav|1|This is another big mistake, especially along the conservatives and the trad cons and all this crap.|641330|645135|3.795
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i094_d005150.wav|1|The idea that a father needs to sit around like a second mother to make a child healthy is is a fallacy.|645205|650355|5.14
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i095_d002330.wav|1|They have a kid, and they basically become mother number 2.|653370|655700|2.32
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i096_d002030.wav|1|As a father, it's your job to be impactful.|658170|660200|2.02
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i097_d003310.wav|1|It's hard to be a superhero if you're home every day, arguing with your wife changing diapers.|667065|670375|3.3
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i098_d006330.wav|1|A man should rock up, teach lessons, be impactful, and it's more about quality as opposed to quantity of time.|671870|678200|6.32
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i099_d005150.wav|1|When he came home, it was an impactful time, whether it was a positive impact or it was a big argument or whatever.|687300|692450|5.14
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i100_d002010.wav|1|And I remember every single second spent with him.|697195|699205|2.0
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i101_d002650.wav|1|There's a whole bunch of dudes out here and chicks.|699195|701845|2.64
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i102_d003326.wav|1|But if you're home all the time, you're gonna lose to a degree your mystery.|703915|707241|3.315
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i103_d004110.wav|1|Doesn't matter how cool you are as individual, you're home all the time, always.|707230|711340|4.1
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i104_d003550.wav|1|You're not gonna have that magical power as opposed to, woah, dad's home.|711390|714940|3.54
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i105_d006330.wav|1|I'm telling you, the biggest mistake fathers make is that they let the woman convince them that to be a good dad, they need to be there all the time.|715065|721395|6.32
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i106_d002751.wav|1|We were always at war or down the coal mines or away working.|723920|726671|2.74
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i107_d002090.wav|1|This is the way it's always been for the for humanity.|726800|728890|2.08
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i108_d002110.wav|1|The men were away doing important things.|729280|731390|2.1
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i110_d004650.wav|1|Because for a female to retain her attraction is to a man, there has to be a degree of mystery.|745630|750280|4.64
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i111_d004270.wav|1|So we're talking about household where even the woman truly respects her man.|751455|755725|4.26
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i112_d004335.wav|1|There's a bunch of dudes out here, bunch of people are married, who are home every day, low testosterone levels.|756095|760430|4.325
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i113_d003535.wav|1|A woman is more attracted to a man who gives a little bit of mystery.|764260|767795|3.525
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i114_d002205.wav|1|And I said, oh, I do this and this and this and this.|772905|775110|2.195
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i115_d002155.wav|1|Alternatively, you say, what's your job?|790385|792540|2.145
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i116_d003150.wav|1|And I say, I look after my people.|792530|795680|3.14
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i117_d006670.wav|1|But the point I'm making is the story you're gonna construct in your head is actually gonna be more interesting to you than the truth.|799285|805955|6.66
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i118_d005930.wav|1|You're gonna say what my man just $25 on dinner, pull up in a $400,000 car, looks after his people.|806040|811970|5.92
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i119_d004750.wav|1|When you watch a horror movie, what what scares you is not the ghost that's on the screen.|814795|819545|4.74
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i120_d002745.wav|1|A degree of mystery is extremely intriguing to the human mind.|826270|829015|2.735
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i121_d002891.wav|1|So it's extremely intriguing to the female for her man is the first thing.|829085|831976|2.88
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i122_d002511.wav|1|And it's also extremely intriguing to the child for their father.|831965|834476|2.5
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i123_d005390.wav|1|Whether it's positive or negative, that has an impact on you, has a a genuine effect on your psyche.|840860|846250|5.38
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i124_d003175.wav|1|I see so many fathers walk in the house and the kids are just playing a video game.|846300|849475|3.165
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i125_d002890.wav|1|Dad walks in, and they don't give a shit.|849465|852355|2.88
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i126_d002345.wav|1|Are you a good dad now because you're home every day?|853625|855970|2.335
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i127_d007231.wav|1|There no one no one can question what I'm saying when it comes to being a father or parenting because I was raised in a very specific way, and I'm one of the greatest men on the face of the planet.|857640|864871|7.22
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i128_d007925.wav|1|So if I had a son, it would be my duty to be out here traveling the world, making money, having impact, being a fantastic individual.|868545|876470|7.915
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i129_d004815.wav|1|That is the primary focus of my existence as opposed to sitting there with my boy all day every day.|876760|881575|4.805
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i130_d002010.wav|1|I can come home every 2 weeks with the story.|881565|883575|2.0
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i133_d004090.wav|1|I mean, it's hard to quantify in a very, very specific quantifiable way.|899865|903955|4.08
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i134_d005605.wav|1|But the point is, if you make a large enough impact, you could see her I if I had a son, I could see him once a year.|905065|910670|5.595
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i135_d002170.wav|1|But my son should want to emulate me.|911360|913530|2.16
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i136_d002270.wav|1|So I have to live a lifestyle which is worth emulating.|915675|917945|2.26
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i137_d003950.wav|1|This is the difference between kings and peasants, and this is the problem with the world today.|918155|922105|3.94

wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i139_d003371.wav|1|All the crypto dorks, all these dudes, all these losers, they're peasants.|926000|929371|3.36
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i140_d003886.wav|1|When a king had a son, he wasn't staying at home changing diapers.|931280|935166|3.875
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i141_d007615.wav|1|He was conquering new lands and going to battle for the name, for the bloodline, to set an example for his son to graze into.|935375|942990|7.605
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i142_d002430.wav|1|That's what how a king raises a son by example.|950095|952525|2.42
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i143_d003150.wav|1|A peasant raises a son the same way a female raises a son.|952975|956125|3.14
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i144_d007895.wav|1|This is all new age garbage, and it's it's the the femme centric mindset, which is controlling men to the point where they can't be honest amongst themselves.|962120|970015|7.885
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i145_d003610.wav|1|The higher your testosterone level, the la the lower your natural interest in babies.|973720|977330|3.6
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i146_d008215.wav|1|And what happens is when a man sits around a baby all the time, his testosterone level naturally decreases because it makes us more tolerant of the screaming, of the crying, woman's moaning.|980360|988575|8.205
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i147_d002811.wav|1|It's hard to be around all that crap when your testosterone level is high.|989024|991835|2.8
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i148_d004970.wav|1|So especially as a man, if you decide to be a second mother to some degree, you're chemically castrating yourself.|992530|997500|4.96
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i149_d002411.wav|1|If you have a high testosterone level, you should wanna see your children.|1000004|1002415|2.4

wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i205_d003025.wav|1|So all the systems are femcentric, and the culture is femcentric.|1328720|1331745|3.015
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i206_d004891.wav|1|Everything we just talked about a man, how he's supposed to raise a kid, that's gonna be mind blowing to some people.|1331955|1336846|4.88

wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i226_d009660.wav|1|I am sure I hold the record for the the the quickest reaction to the lockdown because there's a lot of people now who understand that the things we were told, they were not necessarily true.|1422085|1431745|9.65

wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i233_d011375.wav|1|So the whole thing is a scam, and I like to think I hold the record because at the very, very, very beginning of lockdowns, all the people now who who are anti mask and anti lockdown, they all complied.|1476070|1487445|11.365
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i234_d005231.wav|1|Within 3 seconds of this garbage, we're on planes flying to Sweden and Belarus because the last countries were not locked now.|1492409|1497640|5.22

wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i239_d003610.wav|1|So let's take the bravest possible choice because you can't hide from a disease.|1520555|1524165|3.6

wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i241_d008435.wav|1|Turns out we went to Sweden for 2 months in a in a wide open country partying nonstop while everyone else was locked in their houses, and we realized, oh, everything's fine.|1531100|1539535|8.425
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i242_d004430.wav|1|Now if every other man did that exact same thing, we wouldn't be where we are 2 years later.|1539525|1543955|4.42
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i243_d006031.wav|1|The reason we are suffering because we are suffering is suffering the way we are suffering is because of the monumental cowardice of man.|1544159|1550190|6.02

wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i249_d005530.wav|1|You you you we just started this interview, and you said it's unusual that I say a man should have more than 1 female.|1581850|1587380|5.52
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i251_d002191.wav|1|But the point I'm making is everything translates.|1598180|1600371|2.18
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i252_d005876.wav|1|If you're gonna find a man who's truly warrior minded, who's truly conquest minded, who's truly hard to govern.|1601700|1607576|5.865
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i253_d003131.wav|1|Is he gonna get one chick and let her tell him what to do with his his life?|1607945|1611076|3.12

wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i255_d004671.wav|1|And and this is where we also tie into loyalty because loyalty is a completely misunderstood concept.|1614139|1618810|4.66
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i256_d002991.wav|1|But male loyalty, masculine loyalty is completely misunderstood.|1621965|1624956|2.98
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i257_d003210.wav|1|All these dudes out here who are at home with their wife thinking they're loyal.|1625725|1628935|3.2
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i258_d004190.wav|1|Loyalty is having options and returning to the same place, not only having one option.|1630070|1634260|4.18
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i259_d004075.wav|1|If I walk into the store and they only sell apples and I buy an apple, I'm not loyal to apples.|1635190|1639265|4.065
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i260_d002990.wav|1|Loyalty is walking in the store where they sell all the fruit.|1640375|1643365|2.98
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i261_d002270.wav|1|I buy apples 6 days a week.|1643895|1646165|2.26
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i262_d003530.wav|1|Occasionally, I get big fat pineapple, and I go back to apples the day after.|1646440|1649970|3.52
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i263_d002110.wav|1|Without choice, there's no loyalty.|1651080|1653190|2.1
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i264_d005450.wav|1|So most of these dudes and most women who say he's loyal, he's loyal, he's lame, and he can't get nothing else.|1653475|1658925|5.44
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i265_d003345.wav|1|Loyal is a dude who has all those options and still is in love with you.|1659955|1663300|3.335
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i266_d003151.wav|1|So masculine loyalty is completely misconstrued and misunderstood anyway.|1664169|1667320|3.14
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i267_d003770.wav|1|Truth is about most of these dudes who talk about being loyal, they couldn't get something else if their life depended on it.|1667450|1671220|3.76

wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i278_d003141.wav|1|Because most of these chicks out here and most of these dudes out here do compromise.|1720364|1723505|3.13

wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i281_d005737.wav|1|If you're saying that I value sexual exclusivity above everything else, that's fine, but you're gonna have to compromise.|1736168|1741905|5.726

wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i283_d005906.wav|1|If you want a top top top tier man, he's gonna do certain things, and most women intrinsically know this.|1755044|1760950|5.895

wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i285_d006195.wav|1|My point is women intrinsically understand that certain value of male that they're not gonna get sexual exclusivity, and they don't care.|1772385|1778580|6.185
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i286_d002170.wav|1|They only try and get that crap from beta males.|1779030|1781200|2.16

wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i290_d008595.wav|1|But the fact that he is sexually exclusive to you means that for some reason, we don't know why yet, there's a human metric in which he does not excel in every form.|1799945|1808540|8.585
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i291_d003791.wav|1|So you can go out there and like I said, Toyotas are more really reliable.|1808530|1812321|3.78

wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i295_d010985.wav|1|So this is my point, is that the the the true masculine and true in the realm of true masculine excellence, one of the benefits of such is sexual exclusivity because females, you have the you have so many choices.|1834685|1845670|10.975
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i296_d002110.wav|1|Most men out here have no choice.|1846040|1848150|2.1
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i297_d005036.wav|1|And the very few men who are at the peak of the human experience of a man have all the choice.|1848440|1853476|5.025
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i298_d008015.wav|1|And to find a man who has all the choice, which is extremely rare amongst males, like, less than 1%, and say, you're gonna be with me and me only, it's hard.|1853525|1861540|8.005
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i307_d003050.wav|1|So, I mean, that's why I have to raise him right because, well, you're the next warrior class.|1921995|1925045|3.04
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i308_d002591.wav|1|But I'm gonna make about 20, so don't worry about it.|1925755|1928346|2.58
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i309_d013635.wav|1|To be the pessimist in me kinda thinks that this is different than all the other tyranny they've tried to enact before because they have a technological advantage, and they're getting existing.|1931160|1944795|13.625
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i310_d008740.wav|1|I really part of me is not scared, but part of me is pessimistic in regards to the fact that they have the tools now to to put things in place which are gonna be extremely difficult to break.|1944785|1953525|8.73
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i311_d003130.wav|1|I didn't have much before this, and now I've lost it all.|1958395|1961525|3.12
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i312_d009201.wav|1|And the biggest mental shift for me has been before all this crap, it was the BLM riots and Trump and all this stuff, and everyone was screaming all cops are bad.|1962795|1971996|9.19
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i313_d003310.wav|1|The police are the police are the out here, the ones actually cracking skulls.|1980950|1984260|3.3
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i314_d008105.wav|1|It's amazing that a very few elite could tell another select group of the slaves to go and enact tyranny upon the other group of the slaves, and they're gonna obey.|1984605|1992710|8.095
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i315_d002491.wav|1|Like, this could all end overnight if the police would wake up and say, no.|1992779|1995270|2.48
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i316_d002090.wav|1|So I've lost faith in the law enforcement systems.|1997820|1999910|2.08
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i317_d002910.wav|1|I've lost faith in governments to the point where I sold all my real estate.|2001715|2004625|2.9
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i318_d002810.wav|1|I refuse to even hold real estate under a government.|2005875|2008685|2.8
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i319_d002910.wav|1|Some cops are gonna turn up with a piece of paper and you're out.|2019465|2022375|2.9
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i320_d004750.wav|1|My my answer to all of this is the organization that I control and run, the war room.|2030770|2035520|4.74
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i321_d003550.wav|1|Our or what we do in our organization is we try very, very hard.|2036005|2039555|3.54
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i322_d002590.wav|1|We prepare people to be adaptable.|2039605|2042195|2.58
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i323_d004730.wav|1|So in regards to their finances, in regards to getting multiple passports, that kind of thing, because Darwin said it.|2042920|2047650|4.72
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i324_d007675.wav|1|So I think the smartest thing you can do in the current times is try and prepare yourself or try and construct a life which allows you to be adaptable because nobody knows what's coming next.|2058640|2066315|7.665
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i325_d002170.wav|1|I don't know what's coming next and nobody knows where to be.|2066305|2068475|2.16
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i326_d002972.wav|1|It's very very hard to be proactive in such a chaotic environment.|2068464|2071436|2.96
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i327_d003075.wav|1|So I'm trying to save myself and my people.|2074225|2077300|3.065
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i328_d002831.wav|1|Because a lot of these people out here, they deserve the slavery.|2080310|2083141|2.82
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i329_d009177.wav|1|At the beginning of this crap, when I saw all the masculine influencers on Twitter, the whole atmosphere, everything, when I saw them all all be pussies, all, everyone.|2086464|2095641|9.165
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i330_d002110.wav|1|The bravery was required at the beginning.|2108715|2110825|2.1
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i331_d004910.wav|1|When me and my brother were getting arrested in Germany for refusing to wear masks, you were at home tweeting pro mask.|2110910|2115820|4.9
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i332_d005075.wav|1|All these losers, all of them, all the conservative, all the right wing, all the masculine, you were all cowards.|2116030|2121105|5.065
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i333_d003211.wav|1|All of you, and you all deserve the slavery which is gonna be bestowed upon you.|2121314|2124525|3.2
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i334_d005916.wav|1|If I if I have tweeted something pro mask, I would be issuing a public apology each week.|2124514|2130430|5.905
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i335_d006985.wav|1|I am sorry for the a I'm sorry for the fact that I aided in the enslavement of man by believing the propaganda machine.|2130560|2137545|6.975
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i336_d004085.wav|1|They're just gonna gonna sit there and start now changing it and tweeting Antony Mask and think that nobody notices.|2142315|2146400|4.075
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i337_d002350.wav|1|I lost respect for so many people.|2148050|2150400|2.34
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i338_d004090.wav|1|How are you gonna roll next to me, be my boy, if you're gonna fall for propaganda program?|2154965|2159055|4.08
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i339_d003470.wav|1|How are we gonna sit in a police interview if you fall for propaganda programming?|2160920|2164390|3.46
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i340_d002910.wav|1|But with you with you, pussies, I might be thinking maybe.|2170645|2173555|2.9
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i341_d002110.wav|1|Most of the people out here deserve the slavery.|2176920|2179030|2.1
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i342_d006356.wav|1|And I really do think that there's gonna be a social split even worse than before in regards to the rich and the poor.|2179320|2185676|6.345
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i343_d004890.wav|1|What's gonna happen is you're gonna have people who have absolute freedom and people who have complete I think it's gonna be polarized.|2185665|2190555|4.88
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i344_d002810.wav|1|So worst case, I'll be in my jet, do my thing.|2195110|2197920|2.8
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i345_d002655.wav|1|But, man, I I don't wanna be pessimistic or nothing.|2201510|2204165|2.645
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i346_d004990.wav|1|But when the rally call came at the beginning of the battle, I stood there by myself.|2204155|2209145|4.98
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i347_d003370.wav|1|I stood me interested to understand now, like, where is everybody else?|2209670|2213040|3.36
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i348_d002090.wav|1|And you you can I don't need to name names?|2213030|2215120|2.08
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i349_d008165.wav|1|Anyone who's on Twitter, every single mask account you can think of, all the big strong men, the red pill, alpha, all the conservatives, da da da, all cowards.|2215110|2223275|8.155
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i350_d002255.wav|1|You can go through their accounts to see all of them cuck out.|2223965|2226220|2.245
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i351_d003406.wav|1|I know I look like that guy, but I even I have limits to my abilities, baby.|2233010|2236416|3.395
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i358_d002395.wav|1|They they know how to find your ass when you owe them money.|2281485|2283880|2.385
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i359_d004411.wav|1|But it's it's never you know, like, if they owe you money, it takes months months months to turn up, if ever.|2284189|2288600|4.4
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i360_d002191.wav|1|But if you owe them money, it's a who who repurpose.|2288909|2291100|2.18
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i361_d002651.wav|1|It's like the entire financial system, which we can discuss at length.|2292555|2295206|2.64
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i362_d005695.wav|1|Our entire financial system is designed to steal wealth from the poor and just turn it into numbers on the screen of the ring.|2295195|2300890|5.685
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i363_d005595.wav|1|And and when you understand the system, you understand that the system is rigged to a point where most people do not stand a chance to ever ever win.|2303520|2309115|5.585
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i365_d005290.wav|1|But my but my my very basic premise of it is is that there's a whole bunch of people out here who are effectively slaves.|2315840|2321130|5.28
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i366_d002970.wav|1|And when you're you're a slave if you have a job in in any form Mhmm.|2321120|2324090|2.96
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i367_d003230.wav|1|Some slaves are better paid than others, but most people are slaves.|2324805|2328035|3.22
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i368_d007595.wav|1|In the days of slavery, what would happen is the slave masters would use control and aggression and influence to convince you to do work for free.|2328325|2335920|7.585
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i369_d004325.wav|1|So what they could do is they could get work out of you with something that they can generate from the sky.|2335910|2340235|4.315
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i370_d006350.wav|1|They can be aggressive from the sky, influence from the sky, couple bullets are cheap, whatever it took, and they could get your labor.|2340625|2346975|6.34
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i371_d002430.wav|1|Now we have the exact same thing, but they just use fiat.|2347025|2349455|2.42
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i372_d008075.wav|1|If the people in charge of the world can print unlimited amounts of said thing and you'll give up your life for certain amounts of said thing, then they own you.|2350780|2358855|8.065
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i373_d002510.wav|1|Oh, you need a $100 to do this print.|2359645|2362155|2.5
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i374_d002250.wav|1|So the entire world is a slavery system to some degree.|2366450|2368700|2.24
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i375_d002890.wav|1|Maybe you can make enough of those dollars and buy your freedom as I have.|2368690|2371580|2.88
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i376_d002365.wav|1|But in general, it's a slave system.|2372210|2374575|2.355
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i377_d007865.wav|1|And anyone who's out here who still believes because it seems to be there are some people who still believe in, like, saving up and save my money.|2374565|2382430|7.855
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i378_d005291.wav|1|And if I'm really diligent, I get a mortgage, and in 28 years, I might own the pro man, it's a trap.|2382419|2387710|5.28
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i379_d003551.wav|1|Have you ever met a rich person, asked them why how they got rich, and they said saving?|2389284|2392835|3.54
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i380_d002490.wav|1|And everything they teach you about financial literacy is a lie.|2401720|2404210|2.48
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i383_d002750.wav|1|I just you know, I I've always my entire life.|2429195|2431945|2.74
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i384_d003051.wav|1|So at the age of 5, I was Indiana state chess champion.|2434959|2438010|3.04
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i385_d003995.wav|1|And when I was 8, I was on my way to become a Fede master, so I was one of those child chess geniuses.|2438000|2441995|3.985
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i386_d005530.wav|1|I never actually ended up becoming a a chess master because we moved to, um, England, my father stayed in America, blah blah blah.|2442225|2447755|5.52
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i387_d004415.wav|1|But I've always been good at pretty pretty good at analyzing the chessboard.|2447745|2452160|4.405
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i388_d005825.wav|1|And even from a very, very young age, I just understood, and I don't know exactly where I got it from.|2452690|2458515|5.815
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i389_d002190.wav|1|I understood the world is a scam.|2458585|2460775|2.18
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i390_d005105.wav|1|I was walking to school one day, walking to college, 6th form, with my 4 friends, and a Ferrari went past.|2461865|2466970|5.095
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i391_d002111.wav|1|I was like, bro, how do we get one of them?|2467920|2470031|2.1
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i392_d004730.wav|1|Doesn't that anger you that he has 400 g's for a car and our parents are broke or on a council estate?|2474235|2478965|4.72
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i393_d002011.wav|1|Like, the average man has no fire inside of him.|2481834|2483845|2.0
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i394_d002250.wav|1|I couldn't sleep for 3 days till I saw a Ferrari.|2484540|2486790|2.24
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i395_d002185.wav|1|Only only 4, but I have 22 cars as a whole.|2491740|2493925|2.175
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i396_d002091.wav|1|But, um, the but this is the exact point.|2500074|2502165|2.08
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i397_d010076.wav|1|And what happened is growing up in Luton, especially, all the the Asian boys who are driving these fast cars, when you go to, uh, petrol station 3 in the morning and a Lambo and a Ferrari pull up, you know they're they're done dealing drugs.|2504310|2514386|10.065
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i398_d002910.wav|1|And you don't look at them and go, oh, he worked hard in school.|2514615|2517525|2.9
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i399_d005956.wav|1|So you so I always had an intrinsic understanding that the the only way to truly get rich is to break the system in some degree.|2519895|2525851|5.945
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i400_d008825.wav|1|So when I was going to school and the the school was trying to purport the system, they're trying to, uh, convince me that the system is the best way to have a successful life.|2526140|2534965|8.815
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i401_d002750.wav|1|I was sitting there going, but everyone's living life I want.|2534955|2537705|2.74
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i402_d003230.wav|1|The final straw for me is I actually did very, very good on my a levels.|2540360|2543590|3.22
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i403_d005290.wav|1|I got an a in business after only 3 of the 5 tests because I aced every single one.|2545455|2550745|5.28
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i404_d006796.wav|1|I did this advanced test, this distinction, got a distinction, this, and I was offered, uh, free university in the UK in Ascot.|2550735|2557531|6.785
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i405_d003151.wav|1|So, um, but then they asked me to do a personal statement.|2563835|2566986|3.14
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i406_d003610.wav|1|You threw away free university over a personal so you could just wrote 1.|2592360|2595970|3.6
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i408_d002671.wav|1|And and and I saw that as a genuine infringement.|2609650|2612321|2.66
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i409_d004265.wav|1|I don't I know I'm smart enough, and and I'm stubborn, and I've always been stubborn.|2615570|2619835|4.255
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i410_d002571.wav|1|I'll be fine without your university, without your personal statement.|2620365|2622936|2.56
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i411_d003475.wav|1|I must have been the only person ever throw away 3 university in the UK, but I didn't go.|2623485|2626960|3.465
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i412_d002250.wav|1|And without hearing uni, I was making money.|2631190|2633440|2.24
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i413_d002165.wav|1|I was carrying boxes of ice in a fish market.|2635350|2637515|2.155
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i414_d002570.wav|1|And I wasn't doing anything elaborate, but at least I was working.|2637805|2640375|2.56
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i415_d006715.wav|1|At least I was getting up at 5 in the morning, running to work, working all day, running to the fight gym, fighting all night, running home.|2640365|2647080|6.705
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i416_d002970.wav|1|They they was literally just run I used to run 9 miles a day to get places.|2651390|2654360|2.96
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i417_d002570.wav|1|So, like, I couldn't wear nice clothes because I get sweaty.|2656275|2658845|2.56
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i418_d004465.wav|1|So all these guys just wear tracks and a t shirt, take my t shirt off of a sudden, slept too much.|2658995|2663460|4.455
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i420_d003155.wav|1|But I I I've always had the point is I've always had that fire inside of me.|2687200|2690355|3.145
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i421_d002431.wav|1|I think every man is born with a masculine fire.|2691705|2694136|2.42
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i422_d007485.wav|1|I think it's certainly the reason why so many things in history happen is the reason why so many arm armies tried to conquer the land that Mhmm.|2694265|2701750|7.475
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i423_d003116.wav|1|Why would the Romans wake up and look in a random direction and say, let's go over there.|2702459|2705575|3.105
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i424_d003605.wav|1|It's been dampened by distraction and consumption and all these things.|2711925|2715530|3.595
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i425_d003290.wav|1|But for me, I think the fact that I was so broke, I couldn't really distract myself.|2715740|2719030|3.28
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i426_d004485.wav|1|It was either a life crime or a life of punching people in the face and get paid for it, so I chose to get paid.|2721980|2726465|4.475
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i427_d004191.wav|1|And, um, yeah, the the original question is why I resisted the system.|2726455|2730646|4.18
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i428_d009070.wav|1|I just I could feel all these little triggers my whole life with the system trying to oppress me, and every single person I saw living the life I was aspiring to was outside of the system.|2730740|2739810|9.06
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i429_d002330.wav|1|Even now to me now, I consider myself outside the system.|2739945|2742275|2.32
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i430_d002010.wav|1|But, you know, like, I love living outside the system.|2750540|2752550|2.0
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i431_d003725.wav|1|I I I really think that I have to be careful what I say on YouTube.|2755660|2759385|3.715
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i433_d006306.wav|1|But any man out here with any kind of money, you have my network, which is The War Room, which is the premier network in the world.|2763534|2769840|6.295
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i434_d007655.wav|1|But you need to be very, very understanding of the fact that if you're gonna stay inside the matrix and be a fully law abiding citizen for the next 10 years, you're gonna get crushed.|2771510|2779165|7.645
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i435_d002490.wav|1|You need to either get another residency to another country.|2780435|2782925|2.48
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i436_d002811.wav|1|I'm I'm telling you, you everyone saw my Twitter during these these lockdowns.|2784489|2787300|2.8
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i437_d004170.wav|1|I had a guy in Russia who get me a business visa through his company to go to Russia during close to close.|2793665|2797835|4.16
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i438_d005515.wav|1|So with my connections, my network, and the number of passports I have, which is in excess of 10, I can do whatever I want.|2798865|2804380|5.505
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i443_d006462.wav|1|But one of the first things we do in the war room is we have a we have a a specific section and a construct that helps people obtain multiple residences.|2826080|2832542|6.451
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i444_d005588.wav|1|Because and the reason that's so important is because if you only have one passport, then one government has jurisdiction over your life.|2832753|2838341|5.577
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i445_d002645.wav|1|Now the idea of living off grid is outdated.|2840330|2842975|2.635
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i446_d004490.wav|1|The idea you're going to go to some hut in the forest and sit there with a bunch of guns and that it's not real.|2843105|2847595|4.48
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i447_d006510.wav|1|The best thing you can do as opposed to living off grid is to live on as many grids as possible because that allows you that allows you a lot more flexibility.|2850400|2856910|6.5
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i448_d003616.wav|1|The height of when I was traveling around, when I wanted to go into a country, they said, you're not allowed in the country.|2857040|2860656|3.605
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i450_d006175.wav|1|Anyway, the point is the war room is the war room, the organization I run, cobrotape.com, that's something we specifically help with.|2871670|2877845|6.165
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i451_d006725.wav|1|So if you're a man and you have any kind of money, you need to be realizing that a degree of that money is worth spending on trying to obtain freedom.|2886555|2893280|6.715
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i454_d002410.wav|1|I don't wanna be rude about crypto people.|2907530|2909940|2.4
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i455_d002713.wav|1|And I'm not I know a lot of crypto guys who are cool.|2912985|2915698|2.702
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i456_d002250.wav|1|I caught Sol at, like, $6 for, uh, yeah.|2922310|2924560|2.24
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i457_d003370.wav|1|So I I love I love crypto, and I love a crypto pump.|2924870|2928240|3.36
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i458_d007125.wav|1|When I say detrimental things about the crypto community, the point I'm trying to make is that many people out here, especially men, are not prepared for wealth.|2929030|2936155|7.115
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i459_d007015.wav|1|And when I say they're not prepared for wealth, they haven't been through the struggle that's gonna allow them to become a man of caliber before they find money.|2936145|2943160|7.005
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i460_d004490.wav|1|They haven't done the running to the fish stall, running to the gym, getting punched in the face for money.|2943150|2947640|4.48
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i461_d004670.wav|1|So what happens when a 19 year old kid catches a crypto pop on some junk like Shiba?|2948305|2952975|4.66
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i462_d002105.wav|1|But a few things have happened.|2955345|2957450|2.095
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i463_d002670.wav|1|1st, his ability to work hard has now been destroyed.|2957440|2960110|2.66
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i464_d002010.wav|1|He will never work hard again.|2960240|2962250|2.0
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i465_d002410.wav|1|Because look how much money he made off with blind luck.|2962400|2964810|2.4
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i466_d005045.wav|1|You think he's ever gonna go out there and get a job and take a a pay the $50 a year and really dedicate?|2964800|2969845|5.035
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i467_d005175.wav|1|Even if he lost all that money, the only thing he could ever think to do is to just try and get another pump.|2970455|2975630|5.165
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i468_d002250.wav|1|So his his whole work ethic's been decimated.|2978500|2980750|2.24
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i469_d009478.wav|1|The second thing that happens when someone like him catches a crypto pump is because he has no life experience, no real world experience, no struggle, etcetera, he's now, Tristan calls them geese.|2981442|2990920|9.467
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i470_d002270.wav|1|Famisse is you turn up with your pretty smile.|3005535|3007805|2.26
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i471_d002910.wav|1|He's got money, but money is nothing more than an amplifier.|3017965|3020875|2.9
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i472_d003235.wav|1|And the problem with most of these crypto dorks is that they were dorks, and now they're rich dorks.|3022765|3026000|3.225
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i473_d002970.wav|1|So the point is that the Lambo is not what makes you a mafia boss.|3042360|3045330|2.96
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i474_d003370.wav|1|The Lambo, if you have all the other qualities, will amplify your qualities into that sphere.|3045320|3048690|3.36
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i475_d006590.wav|1|And the point I'm making about wealth and crypto when I insult these guys is that a lot of these guys don't have any of the qualities they need to be amplified.|3050665|3057255|6.58
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i476_d010405.wav|1|If you're a man, you made a bunch of money on crypto, the the smartest thing you can possibly do is understand that the traditional paths to wealth, free crypto, taught you a lot about being a man.|3059470|3069875|10.395
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i477_d007310.wav|1|If I had to make millions the old fashioned way, I'd I'd have learned to negotiate, how to learn how to handle stress, learn how to work really hard, learn how to network.|3069865|3077175|7.3
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i478_d002030.wav|1|I'd have to learn I'd have to learn so many things.|3077320|3079350|2.02
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i479_d004265.wav|1|So my point is that they've missed so many lessons on the path wealth that wealth used to teach.|3084280|3088545|4.255
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i480_d005530.wav|1|This is why women used to respect money so much, not just for the money, but you knew you were talking to an ambitious, connected, smart, intelligent man.|3088535|3094065|5.52
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i481_d002175.wav|1|Now you can be a man with money, and he's none of them things.|3094375|3096550|2.165
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i482_d002010.wav|1|It's a unique atmosphere we're in.|3099260|3101270|2.0
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i483_d002091.wav|1|And when I say to the when I sold the crypto guys, like, look.|3102939|3105030|2.08
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i484_d002830.wav|1|You need to get some masculine accountability.|3106525|3109355|2.82
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i485_d004385.wav|1|Not to plug, but the war room is exact kind of thing you need to be in, or you need to go down to a fight gym, etcetera, etcetera.|3110205|3114590|4.375
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i486_d002570.wav|1|You need to learn all the lessons you missed on your path to wealth.|3114580|3117150|2.56
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i487_d002831.wav|1|And that's why when I insult crypto guys, that's what I mean, because I'll tell you something.|3117139|3119970|2.82
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i488_d002105.wav|1|I've been to these crypto events blah blah blah blah.|3120260|3122365|2.095
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i489_d002410.wav|1|Maybe some of them have more 100 of 1,000,000 of dollars than me.|3124915|3127325|2.4
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i490_d003365.wav|1|I'm the only one who, if a gun came in the building, would be looking to take the assailant out.|3130595|3133960|3.355
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i491_d002805.wav|1|Money doesn't make you anything, especially not in the harsh reality of earth.|3137310|3140115|2.795
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i492_d003691.wav|1|In the real harsh realities of earth, bravery makes you something, not your money.|3140265|3143956|3.68
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i493_d004235.wav|1|Your madamask ain't gonna save you if some dude rolls up in you with a blade, decides to stick it in your fucking neck.|3143945|3148180|4.225
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i494_d004490.wav|1|And now they're all over Twitter with their little NFTs and their little cartoon faces to get their something.|3152010|3156500|4.48
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i495_d005710.wav|1|And and that's the whole problem with the crypto world is that none of them are actually very impressive people in the in real life.|3161675|3167385|5.7
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i496_d008785.wav|1|There's places you can go where you're gonna have to genuinely be held accountable and struggle and suffer and go through some trauma so you can walk with some pride as opposed to looking like a complete geek.|3178625|3187410|8.775
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i498_d005311.wav|1|Because when I'm lifting weights in the gym, that's a day off because I spent my entire career getting punched in the face.|3194845|3200156|5.3
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i499_d003675.wav|1|I I I I I had 87 professional fights.|3200365|3204040|3.665
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i500_d002510.wav|1|And for the majority of those fights, I didn't even make any money.|3204590|3207100|2.5
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i501_d009225.wav|1|I was I was flying around the world to fight some crazy Kazakh in Armenia for, like, 6, 7 g's coming out with my hand broken, my face busted up.|3209070|3218295|9.215
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i502_d007366.wav|1|Like, I've I've been to hell and back and, okay, yeah, it was self inflicted, but genuinely, genuinely, he's one of the best things that ever happened to me.|3218344|3225710|7.355
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i503_d003791.wav|1|I thank the lord I spent my twenties engaged in constant combat.|3225699|3229490|3.78
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i504_d002410.wav|1|I don't know how there's a full grown man out here.|3229815|3232225|2.4
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i505_d011925.wav|1|If you're watching this, how are you a full grown man past the age of 30, and you never once had the balls, once ever, to get in the cage in a fair fight against a worthy adversary, and you walk the earth without shame.|3232215|3244140|11.915
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i506_d010955.wav|1|I'd be ashamed as a man if I spent my entire twenties, the height of my masculine powers, the height of my ability, and never once did I have the balls to go and meet somebody in fair combat.|3244590|3255545|10.945
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i507_d002250.wav|1|You spent so much time on Pornhub, you're a liar.|3258650|3260900|2.24
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i508_d003405.wav|1|And the crypto community is app man, I'm telling you, I go to some of these crypto things.|3263130|3266535|3.395
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i509_d002570.wav|1|I look around just to see you're all just so so so for loose able.|3266525|3269095|2.56
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i510_d002050.wav|1|Well, I don't wanna get into a side career.|3277050|3279100|2.04
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i511_d005946.wav|1|But the the problem with Pornhub I'm not one of them anti porn dudes.|3280729|3286675|5.935
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i512_d004326.wav|1|But like everything in life, if it's consuming your mind and consuming your thoughts, then you have an issue.|3289185|3293511|4.315
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i513_d003770.wav|1|There's a whole bunch of these crypto dudes, especially, who came and attracted female with all their money.|3295560|3299330|3.76
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i515_d002970.wav|1|And and also, you know what the the biggest thing about money with girls is?|3312340|3315310|2.96
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i516_d002975.wav|1|Because people have this this idea that money is gonna help you get girls.|3315300|3318275|2.965
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i517_d003070.wav|1|So money can help with certain of the things that women find attractive.|3334155|3337225|3.06
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i518_d006565.wav|1|It's very rare unless she's a hooker or a gold digger that women are very, very interested the actual number of how much money you have or spend.|3337995|3344560|6.555
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i519_d009545.wav|1|But what women don't want is you lacking the ability to be spontaneity still to be spontaneous or lacking the ability to be respected because you're broke or to feel like she has FOMO.|3344870|3354415|9.535
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i520_d002090.wav|1|She can't go certain places that her friends go because you're broke.|3355525|3357615|2.08
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i521_d002830.wav|1|So it's not the money in and of itself that attracts her.|3358820|3361650|2.82
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i522_d003450.wav|1|It's the certain options that it gives you as a man that she can find more attractive.|3361700|3365150|3.44
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i523_d010005.wav|1|But here's the thing about money most people don't understand is that for the most beautiful women on earth, the reason they don't really respect your money is everybody they every guy they talk to has money.|3367125|3377130|9.995
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i524_d002810.wav|1|You're never gonna wanna do a a date with a broke dude.|3377920|3380730|2.8
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i525_d002430.wav|1|So every single place you go, you don't pay.|3380720|3383150|2.42
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i526_d003770.wav|1|So do you actually care how much money that guy really has or how much the dinner really was?|3383315|3387085|3.76
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i527_d004175.wav|1|So the point is that money is not enough to to get a beautiful woman.|3388275|3392450|4.165
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i528_d002190.wav|1|It's enough to qualify you to try.|3392520|3394710|2.18
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i529_d004185.wav|1|And she's gonna go with 1 of 10 dudes she can go with, and they all have enough money.|3396840|3401025|4.175
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i530_d003950.wav|1|But they all have enough money to give her the basic things she wants, bit dinner, bit fun, holiday, blah blah blah.|3402455|3406405|3.94
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i531_d005155.wav|1|So if money is all you have and you have absolutely no other qualities, you're gonna lose to the dude who has money and and the other stuff.|3407895|3413050|5.145
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i532_d003356.wav|1|Like, a a chick a chick's not gonna get with you just for having big arms.|3416139|3419495|3.345
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i533_d002650.wav|1|But if she didn't get with a dude, she probably wants her dude to have some arms.|3419885|3422535|2.64
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i534_d002830.wav|1|It's like, I'm gonna give you just for money, but I don't wanna go with a broke guy.|3423405|3426235|2.82
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i535_d002250.wav|1|So, like, women don't really think about money that way.|3426285|3428535|2.24
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i536_d002035.wav|1|They're just like, well, every guy I go on a date with is rich.|3428525|3430560|2.025
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i537_d002030.wav|1|And men lie, especially rich men.|3430550|3432580|2.02
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i538_d002250.wav|1|And there's a man with a million who'll say he has 10.|3432710|3434960|2.24
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i539_d003630.wav|1|Like, it's very rare you get someone like me with so much quantifiable wealth.|3436975|3440605|3.62
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i540_d003850.wav|1|But but, like, I have a fucking $6,000,000 car, Bugatti, all this kind of thing.|3440655|3444505|3.84
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i541_d003050.wav|1|But there's a whole bunch of guys out here who can catch a 400 grand pump.|3445880|3448930|3.04
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i542_d002191.wav|1|I think I can convince the girl he's a multimillionaire for years.|3448919|3451110|2.18
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i544_d003211.wav|1|But the the point I'm making is that these dudes think if I get money, I'll get a chick.|3469810|3473021|3.2
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i545_d004731.wav|1|Because you'll get money, and then the chick you're after is still gonna be dating athletes, superstars, all these dudes.|3473685|3478416|4.72
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i546_d002110.wav|1|You you think your bored ape is gonna impress her?|3479445|3481555|2.1
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i548_d002385.wav|1|And and to get a little bit dark, it's true.|3490710|3493095|2.375
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i549_d004330.wav|1|I knew a girl in Luton who was in an abusive relationship.|3493085|3497415|4.32
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i550_d003450.wav|1|Problem was when she finally left him, in fact, he got banged up for drugs.|3501990|3505440|3.44
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i551_d005465.wav|1|She got some other guy, a nice guy, and she was a complete prick to this dude, and she was so unhappy.|3507510|3512975|5.455
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i552_d003150.wav|1|And the problem was it's very, very hard to be interesting.|3512965|3516115|3.14
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i553_d003265.wav|1|When your ex is a psycho, the new guy's boring.|3516405|3519670|3.255
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i554_d006605.wav|1|I'd say, you're you're going home and you're you're turning up 2 hours late and he ain't even screaming, and you're bored, aren't you?|3522840|3529445|6.595
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i555_d004250.wav|1|I said, you missed the days of the fucking flying plates and shit because it's because it's car day.|3530315|3534565|4.24
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i556_d002430.wav|1|Women watch serial killers documentaries to relax.|3537030|3539460|2.42
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i557_d003485.wav|1|As a generalization, the point I'm making is that you're right.|3553645|3557130|3.475
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i558_d004170.wav|1|Sometimes women are attracted to very, very toxic men because toxic men are not bored.|3557120|3561290|4.16
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i559_d002190.wav|1|You you're never you're never bored with a nutcase.|3561600|3563790|2.18
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i560_d005450.wav|1|And and and then after after a crazy guy, you try and get with a normal guy and you you end up being very, very bored.|3564215|3569665|5.44
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i561_d003935.wav|1|A lot of these dudes right here treating women like complete shit, but she's staying because she's not bored.|3572055|3575990|3.925
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i562_d002110.wav|1|And and it's boring everywhere else in comparison.|3575980|3578090|2.1
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i563_d002695.wav|1|So it's it's just it's just certainly true as a paradigm.|3578620|3581315|2.685
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i571_d003866.wav|1|So so the basic premise is that the paradigm of happiness is is completely misunderstood.|3622935|3626801|3.855
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i572_d003950.wav|1|I believe that because people always say to me, oh, well, you have all this money tape, but are you happy?|3626930|3630880|3.94
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i573_d002330.wav|1|Like, I I guess what they're hoping I'm gonna do.|3632795|3635125|2.32
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i574_d003815.wav|1|But the point is the whole paradigm of happiness is is largely misunderstood.|3638155|3641970|3.805
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i575_d006125.wav|1|And we talk about happiness in society as if it's the most important metric, and I'd actually argue that it's not an important metric at all.|3642500|3648625|6.115
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i576_d009115.wav|1|And it's also really truly amazing how what you define in your mind, the limits you set in your mind of what happy is and what happy isn't becomes very, very true.|3649095|3658210|9.105
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i577_d003210.wav|1|So I watched a very interesting documentary once about colors and Colors.|3658200|3661410|3.2
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i578_d004270.wav|1|And it was a tribe in Africa that used different words to describe colors.|3662200|3666470|4.26
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i579_d003950.wav|1|So to them, blue and yellow are the same color, same word.|3667045|3670995|3.94
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i580_d002730.wav|1|And also these two very different shades of green.|3671765|3674495|2.72
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i581_d004735.wav|1|I'm talking about, like, grass and a leaf, like, basically the same shade of shade of green.|3674485|3679220|4.725
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i582_d003531.wav|1|So when they showed us them blue and yellow and they said, can you tell the difference?|3680490|3684021|3.52
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i583_d003290.wav|1|They they couldn't see it because in their in their mind, it had one word.|3690105|3693395|3.28
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i584_d005795.wav|1|So because they grew up their whole life and I had one word that those two colors within that spectrum to them, it's just like it's one color.|3693385|3699180|5.785
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i585_d002491.wav|1|They couldn't see the difference just like we'd say different various of pink.|3699310|3701801|2.48
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i586_d002330.wav|1|Whereas the 2 very different shades of green, they're like, oh, yeah.|3703955|3706285|2.32
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i587_d007216.wav|1|So the point is their own mental blocks or own mental barriers where they had mentally decided to put the brakes, control their reality.|3708354|3715570|7.205
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i588_d006865.wav|1|And people often talk about being happy, and what they do is they talk about being happy in the same way a child in their very dittish Christmas morning happiness.|3716020|3722885|6.855
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i589_d002276.wav|1|If you were like that all the time, you wouldn't even get anything done.|3728294|3730570|2.265
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i590_d004831.wav|1|So the idea that you're out here searching for that feeling permanently is asinine is immature.|3732479|3737310|4.82
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i591_d002910.wav|1|But I've changed the paradigm of where happiness is.|3739955|3742865|2.9
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i592_d003310.wav|1|For me, anything above the straw is happy.|3742915|3746225|3.3
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i593_d005585.wav|1|Besides 3 or 4 monumentally destructive events are gonna happen throughout my life, like a loss of family member or something.|3746515|3752100|5.575
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i594_d002670.wav|1|Unless I really, really feel down, I'm happy.|3752090|3754760|2.66
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i595_d003095.wav|1|So if I wake up, it's not I'm thinking if I'm happy or not.|3755050|3758145|3.085
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i596_d004575.wav|1|So even if I wake up and I'm furious and I'm stressed and I'm pissed off, I got much to do, I'm still happy.|3762455|3767030|4.565
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i597_d002650.wav|1|My happiness barrier isn't this little giddy ish at the top.|3768200|3770850|2.64
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i598_d002090.wav|1|My happiness is everything besides feeling distraught.|3770840|3772930|2.08
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i599_d006490.wav|1|So I describe myself as a happy person, and I and I don't really put much merit on my feeling of the day.|3774715|3781205|6.48
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i600_d004571.wav|1|I get my shit done regardless of whether I'm super happy or slightly less happy.|3782970|3787541|4.56
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i601_d002650.wav|1|I'm still happy, and I still perform, and that's it as a whole.|3787530|3790180|2.64
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i602_d002045.wav|1|So when I meet guys, I go, oh, I wanna be more happy.|3790170|3792215|2.035
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i603_d004330.wav|1|I'm like, bro, that is a stupid, destructive way to try and live your life.|3792205|3796535|4.32
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i604_d010225.wav|1|To constantly self analyze and compare your happiness to how happy you were at another period, how you're gonna get happy again trying to get to the top one percentile of happiness is stupid.|3796525|3806750|10.215
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i609_d006415.wav|1|Because I think that a lot of the advice that men give to other men is gonna be harsher and more logical and less emotionally led.|3830155|3836570|6.405
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i610_d002891.wav|1|But but I say this all the time to guys who message me and say they're not happy.|3836699|3839590|2.88
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i611_d003816.wav|1|I say, firstly, you shouldn't be measuring or be concerned with how happy you are.|3840380|3844196|3.805
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i612_d002330.wav|1|Shouldn't be something that's in your mind or something you're even thinking about.|3844185|3846515|2.32
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i613_d002351.wav|1|You got other things to think about and other things to do.|3846825|3849176|2.34
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i614_d018135.wav|1|The second thing is So the first thing the fact that you will sit there and self analyze yourself to determine how happy you are out of a score of a 100 is already a mental failure.|3850825|3868960|18.125
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i615_d002685.wav|1|The fact you have time to sit there and go, how happy am I today?|3872850|3875535|2.675
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i616_d008015.wav|1|The second thing is, and this is the truth, most of you, in fact, the large majority of you, don't deserve to be happy.|3879605|3887620|8.005
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i617_d002570.wav|1|Because they haven't done the work it requires to be happy.|3888550|3891120|2.56
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i618_d003355.wav|1|You're not a man of genuine excellence in every human metric.|3891350|3894705|3.345
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i619_d008356.wav|1|You're sitting at your computer with your Bored Ape and your NFTs and $4,000,000, but you're fat and you're boring and you stick and you expect yourself to be happy.|3896354|3904710|8.345

wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i621_d003385.wav|1|You have to get all the way up there to see the peak and its amazing view.|3910700|3914085|3.375
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i622_d002351.wav|1|I'm happy because all I've done is suffer.|3915114|3917465|2.34
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i623_d002170.wav|1|That's why my that's why my world view is so brilliant.|3923430|3925600|2.16
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i624_d004030.wav|1|That's how I can wake up and as long as no one has a gun to my head, I am happy because I have suffered.|3925590|3929620|4.02
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i625_d002730.wav|1|You, ladies and gentlemen, haven't suffered enough.|3931385|3934115|2.72
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i626_d003070.wav|1|If it's just laying all over the floor and anyone can pick it up, it has no value.|3937460|3940530|3.06
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i627_d002431.wav|1|People's entire mental model is skewed.|3940580|3943011|2.42
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i628_d002270.wav|1|NFTs, the whole point of them is that there's 1.|3945525|3947795|2.26
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i629_d002190.wav|1|It's the scarcity that provides the value.|3948005|3950195|2.18
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i630_d002251.wav|1|If things are not scarce, there's no value to it.|3950324|3952575|2.24
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i631_d003346.wav|1|The fact that a guy has big arms, the reason that has value is because it's rare.|3957219|3960565|3.335
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i632_d003130.wav|1|If every dude naturally had big arms by default, it wouldn't have a value.|3960635|3963765|3.12
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i633_d002651.wav|1|So you're talking about happiness as if it should just be laid all over the floor.|3963755|3966406|2.64
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i634_d006965.wav|1|If everyone could pick up happiness without trying, you still wouldn't be happy because it wouldn't have value, and you'd be aiming for a new you'd be looking for a new attention of happiness.|3966395|3973360|6.955
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i635_d007026.wav|1|And And people who are out here trying to find happiness without trauma and suffering, those are the guys who get addicted to drugs, alcohol, all this crap, but they're trying to find temporary happiness.|3975989|3983015|7.015
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i636_d002315.wav|1|You're gonna find happiness through pain.|3983065|3985380|2.305
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i637_d002011.wav|1|That's where happiness comes from as a man.|3985510|3987521|2.0
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i638_d002890.wav|1|And I'm not I know you say you take some of my advice, etcetera, etcetera.|3987510|3990400|2.88
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i639_d003631.wav|1|But it's the struggle that adds the value to things.|3992344|3995975|3.62
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i640_d004666.wav|1|The reason I'm gonna love my car so much is because I had nothing, and now I have them.|3996104|4000770|4.655
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i641_d003985.wav|1|If I was born into money and was just given a Lambo for my birthday, I wouldn't even appreciate it.|4004520|4008505|3.975
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i642_d002250.wav|1|So most of you men out here don't even deserve happiness.|4009375|4011625|2.24
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i643_d002535.wav|1|You know you don't deserve it because you're a coward and you're lazy and you're weak.|4013375|4015910|2.525
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i644_d011585.wav|1|That's your own mind telling you you need to do more, because if you were genuinely genuinely making an impact on the world and exerting your entire masculine force out into the universe, if you were genuinely doing that, you'd find happiness.|4018140|4029725|11.575
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i645_d002775.wav|1|So if you're sitting there feeling depressed, it's because you know you're lazy.|4029715|4032490|2.765
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i647_d002430.wav|1|We we don't wanna feel what's the exact saying?|4044945|4047375|2.42
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i648_d003451.wav|1|We don't wanna feel any pain, but you can't have a rainbow without a little rain.|4052929|4056380|3.44
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i649_d002010.wav|1|But, no, this is as old as human time.|4058050|4060060|2.0
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i650_d012306.wav|1|And the whole people, especially men, if you have this paradigm in your mind that you should just be happy by default without trying, without working, without any kind of struggle, without any negatives in your life, and you're gonna be a happy person, and you're always just gonna be laughing and giggling in the top 1%.|4060755|4073061|12.295
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i651_d002090.wav|1|And this is this is stupid mentality to have.|4074490|4076580|2.08
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i652_d004831.wav|1|If any man comes to me and he's looking for guidance, I say, I don't I I don't really care how happy you are because you're fat.|4078844|4083675|4.82
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i653_d002431.wav|1|You have too much to get done to be talking about happiness.|4087489|4089920|2.42
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i654_d004111.wav|1|Most of you men out here have so much to get done before you talk about happiness.|4089969|4094080|4.1
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i655_d003950.wav|1|It's amazing to me how little work the majority of people out here are doing.|4094425|4098375|3.94
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i656_d010875.wav|1|Like, you're a full grown man living in a transitionary period of of humanity where the entire financial system is broken and 1,000,000,000,000 of dollars are created from the sky and you don't have a single million?|4098505|4109380|10.865
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i657_d002671.wav|1|Like, how are you gonna be a full grown man and not be a millionaire?|4112655|4115326|2.66
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i662_d005117.wav|1|Anything above that, I believe the money no longer has value, and it's better to spend on a human experience.|4140989|4146106|5.105
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i663_d003611.wav|1|Because if you have 30,000,000 or 40,000,000, your life's not gonna change.|4146955|4150566|3.6
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i664_d002726.wav|1|If you have 30,000,000 or a 100,000,000, your life's not gonna change.|4150715|4153441|2.715
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i665_d006010.wav|1|So I'd rather just spunk all that money on human experience and amazing things and try to get the best out of the physical world we live in.|4153910|4159920|6.0
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i666_d002517.wav|1|So that's enough to to survive.|4161509|4164026|2.505
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i667_d002651.wav|1|I see a lot of crypto guys and a lot of other people that are talking about generational wealth.|4166875|4169526|2.64
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i668_d002855.wav|1|I'm gonna save my Bitcoin that they really want their children to be rich.|4169515|4172370|2.845
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i669_d002571.wav|1|I really want to die taking most of my money with me.|4175240|4177811|2.56
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i672_d003946.wav|1|So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna financially incentivize my children.|4192070|4196016|3.935
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i673_d010975.wav|1|They're gonna have the ability to be so when I used to have to run to the gym and suffer and then and fight, and at the end, the guy still didn't have food, My boy's gonna go through all that, and he's gonna fight, and then I'm gonna give him some money.|4196485|4207460|10.965
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i674_d002315.wav|1|Still he has to run to the gym and back, etcetera, etcetera.|4210730|4213045|2.305
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i675_d002270.wav|1|The worst thing you can do for a child is raise some bridge.|4213115|4215385|2.26
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i676_d002650.wav|1|And and so that's the worst thing you can possibly ever do.|4215515|4218165|2.64
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i677_d002830.wav|1|So I have no interest in that whole generational wealth crap.|4218155|4220985|2.82
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i679_d002170.wav|1|I want them to suffer I want them to suffer a lot.|4231185|4233355|2.16
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i680_d004706.wav|1|But they're I'm gonna make sure they go through a law of man because it what makes a man, it was it's what makes him a character.|4236384|4241090|4.695
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i681_d005775.wav|1|But I find it I really find it remarkable when I meet men who say they work hard.|4242520|4248295|5.765
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i682_d002251.wav|1|I'm not being a horrible guy here because I'm from the streets.|4250364|4252615|2.24

wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i695_d002270.wav|1|And then there's dudes out here who are just just sloppy.|4327830|4330100|2.26
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i696_d010945.wav|1|We live in we we were really living in a paradigm shift where the professionals of life and when I say the professional, I'll explain what that means in a minute, but the professionals of life are gonna genuinely excel where all of you amateurs are gonna fail.|4339435|4350380|10.935
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i697_d004235.wav|1|Most people, most men, especially, they live their life like complete amateurs.|4350510|4354745|4.225
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i701_d002270.wav|1|You need to exert a degree of professionalism.|4378150|4380420|2.26
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i702_d003145.wav|1|But you there's a whole bunch of other areas of professionalism you need to excel in.|4384310|4387455|3.135
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i703_d002250.wav|1|You can give me any you can give me any car in the world, basically.|4390725|4392975|2.24
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i704_d003725.wav|1|It's easy to talk about them all, but you can narrow them all down to the exact same thing.|4402270|4405995|3.715
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i705_d003635.wav|1|And and, man, I see full grown men out here, like, wearing a mask.|4411185|4414820|3.625
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i706_d003450.wav|1|It really is incredible to me that that that's the paradigm shift we live in.|4431740|4435190|3.44
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i707_d004805.wav|1|And and it's amazing to me that some of the things I say are seen as so controversial because I don't think I say anything that controversial.|4435180|4439985|4.795
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i708_d003416.wav|1|Try and get rich and try and and try to some degree live with a life of freedom.|4444694|4448110|3.405
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i712_d003310.wav|1|But but what I do is you see, I am I am a a soundboard.|4461205|4464515|3.3
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i713_d010200.wav|1|And what I do is I annoy the majority of men because if you're gonna talk to me or listen to me or compare your life to mine, nearly any man on the planet is gonna, to a degree, be inferior.|4465045|4475245|10.19
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i714_d003765.wav|1|Men need to humble themselves because, uh, especially, like alright.|4477935|4481700|3.755
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i715_d002410.wav|1|And I'm also tall and strong and smart, and I can kick the shit|4484890|4487300|2.4
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i716_d003255.wav|1|And I've got all these and I've got political connections, and I'm living a life of freedom.|4487850|4491105|3.245
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i717_d003690.wav|1|And the the the the like, you're rich, but you're afraid to go outside because someone's gonna rob you.|4491095|4494785|3.68
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i718_d005265.wav|1|So it's very difficult for men to compare themselves to me and not take to some degree take an l, so they have to humble themselves.|4494775|4500040|5.255
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i719_d003070.wav|1|So what happens when I talk to people is either they go, this is inspirational.|4500030|4503100|3.06
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i720_d003690.wav|1|I need to have all these assets and these these, uh, connections, etcetera etcetera.|4509775|4513465|3.68
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i721_d002030.wav|1|Or people go, ah, he's just so arrogant.|4513455|4515485|2.02
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i722_d004426.wav|1|He's crazy, and I'm sitting at home with my wife, and I raise my kids, and he's crazy.|4515614|4520040|4.415
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i723_d002090.wav|1|And and and lots of dudes have cope.|4524650|4526740|2.08
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i724_d003235.wav|1|There's also something that's primal amongst men that women probably don't really know about.|4527770|4531005|3.225
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i725_d006675.wav|1|But as a man, when you meet another man who you know can kick the shit out of you, it it bothers you.|4530995|4537670|6.665
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i726_d002250.wav|1|So even if I meet a dude and I'm really polite, I'm like, hey, bro.|4539180|4541430|2.24
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i727_d002270.wav|1|And it's it's something intrinsic about masculinity.|4547725|4549995|2.26
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i728_d002170.wav|1|It's kinda like when some girls hate girls who appear in them.|4550205|4552375|2.16
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i729_d002037.wav|1|The same kind of thing, but it's just violence related.|4555553|4557590|2.026
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i730_d003443.wav|1|And you could tie and you could also tie into the fact they don't like people who are richer than them.|4561340|4564783|3.433
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i731_d006072.wav|1|So so when they meet me and I'm more important than them, richer than them, I could beat the shit out of them, and then I tick all these boxes, they just sit and go, oh, he's he's crazy.|4567488|4573560|6.062
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i732_d002591.wav|1|I don't like him, and I don't want him on my podcast.|4573550|4576141|2.58
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i733_d003050.wav|1|I've had people record podcasts to me and refuse to put them out.|4576910|4579960|3.04
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i738_d002751.wav|1|And I believe I have a duty to protect the bloodline.|4624194|4626945|2.74
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i739_d003615.wav|1|Unfortunately, he's no longer with us, which now promotes me to the greatest man on the planet.|4633580|4637195|3.605
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i740_d009086.wav|1|So I have a lot of work to do, and I think that the duty I have to my bloodline, it depends the exact path I'm gonna take.|4642305|4651391|9.075
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i741_d002775.wav|1|I don't know if I'm gonna have 20 sons with 20 women.|4651380|4654155|2.765
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i742_d003310.wav|1|We're gonna find 1 woman who might give me 2 or 3, etcetera.|4654205|4657515|3.3
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i743_d006235.wav|1|But I think the family is a beautiful thing, but the nuclear family as it's told within this trad, calm, conservative, that's garbage.|4657645|4663880|6.225
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i744_d010245.wav|1|If you were to ask me now to design my ideal life, like, if I could just design it, I'd have 3 or 4 sons in Moscow, 3 or 4 sons in Kazakhstan, maybe 2 or 3 sons in Mongolia.|4664090|4674335|10.235
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i745_d002350.wav|1|My 3 chicks, inshallah, my 3 wives.|4675505|4677855|2.34

wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i747_d002810.wav|1|And in the future, as much as people go, Tate, you can't do that.|4682770|4685580|2.8
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i748_d005215.wav|1|In the future, when the dystopian, when the machines arrive, when the terminators turn up and you're like, where's John Connor?|4688281|4693496|5.204
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i749_d003130.wav|1|Oh, he was an act of fiction, but there is a man there is a man who does exist.|4694230|4697360|3.12
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i750_d003290.wav|1|He's from deep in Mongolia, and his name's Emery Andrew Tate the 5th.|4698390|4701680|3.28
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i751_d002886.wav|1|And he's gonna rise up because even I am human.|4701670|4704556|2.875

wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i753_d003790.wav|1|But when I am old, I need to make sure I've done my job because it's it would be a detriment.|4712210|4716000|3.78
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i754_d005310.wav|1|It would be unfair to humanity for me to not create clones of myself to protect the future.|4716210|4721520|5.3
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i755_d002670.wav|1|My plan is to protect the future via my offspring.|4722805|4725475|2.66
wavs/DG_Speaker_1_i761_d003076.wav|1|But I I have a I say some things that sound outlandish.|4763154|4766230|3.065
